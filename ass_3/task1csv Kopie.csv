114, The word "house" is  not a linguistic fact if by it is meant merely the acoustic effect  produced on the ear by its constituent consonants and vowels  pronounced  in a certain order  nor the motor processes and tactile feelings which  make up the articulation of the word  nor the visual perception on the  part of the hearer of this articulation  nor the visual perception of  the word "house" on the written or printed page  nor the motor processes  and tactile feelings which enter into the writing of the word  nor the  memory of any or all of these experiences,1,1
107, The dimensions of the science  of language are so vast that it is impossible in a course of nine lectures  to give more than a very general survey of it  and as one of the greatest  charms of this science consists in the minuteness of the analysis by which  each language  each dialect  each word  each grammatical form is tested  I  felt that it was almost impossible to do full justice to my subject  or to  place the achievements of those who founded and fostered the science of  language in their true light,2,1
106,' If  with all these difficulties and drawbacks  I  do not shrink from opening to-day this course of lectures on mere words   on nouns and verbs and particles  ''97if I venture to address an audience  accustomed to listen  in this place  to the wonderful tales of the natural  historian  the chemist  and geologist  and wont to see the novel results  of inductive reasoning invested by native eloquence  with all the charms  of poetry and romance  ''97it is because  though mistrusting myself  I cannot  mistrust my subject',2,2
106, The astronomer retains these and many other names  he  still speaks of the pole of heaven  of wandering and fixed stars (6) but  he is apt to forget that these terms were not the result of scientific  observation and classification  but were borrowed from the language of  those who themselves were wanderers on the sea or in the desert  and to  whom the fixed stars were in full reality what their name implies  stars  driven in and fixed  by which they might hold fast on the deep  as by  heavenly anchors,2,3
102, This can only mean that the sounds of speech are  localized in the auditory tract of the brain  or in some circumscribed  portion of it  precisely as other classes of sounds are localized  and  that the motor processes involved in speech (such as the movements of  the glottal cords in the larynx  the movements of the tongue required to  pronounce the vowels  lip movements required to articulate certain  consonants  and numerous others) are localized in the motor tract  precisely as are all other impulses to special motor activities,1,2
98, I felt convinced that the  researches into the history of languages and into the nature of human  speech which have been carried on for the last fifty years in England   France  and Germany  deserved a larger share of public sympathy than they  had hitherto received  and it seemed to me  as far as I could judge  that  the discoveries in this newly-opened mine of scientific inquiry were not  inferior  whether in novelty or importance  to the most brilliant  discoveries of our age,2,4
91, Now  although it may seem as if in the present high state of our  society students were enabled to devote their time to the investigation of  the facts and laws of nature  or to the contemplation of the mysteries of  the world of thought  without any side-glance at the practical result of  their labors  no science and no art have long prospered and flourished  among us  unless they were in some way subservient to the practical  interests of society,2,5
85, The auditory centers  alone may be excited  or the impulse to linguistic expression may be  communicated as well to the motor nerves that communicate with the  organs of speech but be inhibited either in the muscles of these organs  or at some point in the motor nerves themselves  or  possibly  the  auditory centers may be only slightly  if at all  affected  the speech  process manifesting itself directly in the motor sphere,1,3
85,' As long as the  Egyptian science excited the hopes of the invalid by mysterious  prescriptions (I may observe by the way that the hieroglyphic signs of our  modern prescriptions have been traced back by Champollion to the real  hieroglyphics of Egypt(7)) ''97and as long as it instigated the avarice of its  patrons by the promise of the discovery of gold  it enjoyed a liberal  support at the courts of princes  and under the roofs of monasteries',2,6
84,    But although historically we are justified in saying that the first  geometrician was a ploughman  the first botanist a gardener  the first  mineralogist a miner  it may reasonably be objected that in this early  stage a science is hardly a science yet: that measuring a field is not  geometry  that growing cabbages is very far from botany  and that a  butcher has no claim to the title of comparative anatomist,2,7
83, The  auditory symbolism may be replaced  point for point  by a motor or by a  visual symbolism (many people can read  for instance  in a purely visual  sense  that is  without the intermediating link of an inner flow of the  auditory images that correspond to the printed or written words) or by  still other  more subtle and elusive  types of transfer that are not so  easy to define,1,4
80, Now if the moon was originally  called by the farmer the measurer  the ruler of days  and weeks  and  seasons  the regulator of the tides  the lord of their festivals  and the  herald of their public assemblies  it is but natural that he should have  been conceived as a man  and not as the love-sick maiden which our modern  sentimental poetry has put in his place,2,8
79, Naturally the  particular points or clusters of points of localization in the several  tracts that refer to any element of language are connected in the brain  by paths of association  so that the outward  or psycho-physical  aspect  of language  is of a vast network of associated localizations in the  brain and lower nervous tracts  the auditory localizations being without  doubt the most fundamental of all for speech,1,5

77, It is even conceivable  if not  exactly likely  that certain operators may have learned to think  directly  so far as the purely conscious part of the process of thought  is concerned  in terms of the tick-auditory symbolism or  if they happen  to have a strong natural bent toward motor symbolism  in terms of the  correlated tactile-motor symbolism developed in the sending of  telegraphic messages,1,7
75, But before we  enter upon a definition of its subject-matter  and determine the method  which ought to be followed in our researches  it will be useful to cast a  glance at the history of the other sciences  among which the science of  language now  for the first time  claims her place  and examine their  origin  their gradual progress  and definite settlement,2,9
72,' As such  they may be considered an integral portion of speech  in the properly  cultural sense of the term  being no more identical with the instinctive  cries themselves than such words as "cuckoo" and "kill-deer" are  identical with the cries of the birds they denote or than Rossini''s  treatment of a storm in the overture to "William Tell" is in fact a  storm',1,8
72,    Although the way which is before us may be long and tedious  the point to  which it tends would seem to be full of interest  and I believe I may  promise that the view opened before our eyes from the summit of our  science  will fully repay the patient travellers  and perhaps secure a  free pardon to their venturous guide,2,10
71, Were the symbol "house" whether  an auditory  motor  or visual experience or image attached but to the  single image of a particular house once seen  it might perhaps  by an  indulgent criticism  be termed an element of speech  yet it is obvious  at the outset that speech so constituted would have little or no value  for purposes of communication,1,9
68, Some of these systems are  one-to-one equivalences of the normal system of speech  others  like  military gesture-symbolism or the gesture language of the Plains Indians  of North America (understood by tribes of mutually unintelligible forms  of speech) are imperfect transfers  limiting themselves to the rendering  of such grosser speech elements as are an imperative minimum under  difficult circumstances,1,10
