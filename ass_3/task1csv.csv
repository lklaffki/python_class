17, It seems as natural to man as walking  and only less so than  breathing,1
22, Yet it needs but a moment's reflection to convince us that  this naturalness of speech is but an illusory feeling,1
27, The process of  acquiring speech is  in sober fact  an utterly different sort of thing  from the process of learning to walk,1
30, In the case of the latter  function  culture  in other words  the traditional body of social usage   is not seriously brought into play,1
34, The child is individually equipped   by the complex set of factors that we term biological heredity  to make  all the needed muscular and nervous adjustments that result in walking,1
38,  Indeed  the very conformation of these muscles and of the appropriate  parts of the nervous system may be said to be primarily adapted to the  movements made in walking and in similar activities,1
67, In a very real  sense the normal human being is predestined to walk  not because his  elders will assist him to learn the art  but because his organism is  prepared from birth  or even from the moment of conception  to take on  all those expenditures of nervous energy and all those muscular  adaptations that result in walking,1
16, To put it concisely  walking is an  inherent  biological function of man,1
7,    Not so language,1
59, It is of course true that in a certain sense the  individual is predestined to talk  but that is due entirely to the  circumstance that he is born not merely in nature  but in the lap of a  society that is certain  reasonably certain  to lead him to its  traditions,1
26, Eliminate society and there is every reason to believe that  he will learn to walk  if  indeed  he survives at all,1
32, But it is just as  certain that he will never learn to talk  that is  to communicate ideas  according to the traditional system of a particular society,1
28, Or  again   remove the new-born individual from the social environment into which he  has come and transplant him to an utterly alien one,1
25, He will develop the  art of walking in his new environment very much as he would have  developed it in the old,1
17, But his speech will be completely at variance  with the speech of his native environment,1
25, Walking  then  is a general  human activity that varies only within circumscribed limits as we pass  from individual to individual,1
8, Its variability is involuntary and  purposeless,1
41, Speech is a human activity that varies without assignable  limit as we pass from social group to social group  because it is a  purely historical heritage of the group  the product of long-continued  social usage,1
39, It varies as all creative effort varies not as  consciously  perhaps  but none the less as truly as do the religions   the beliefs  the customs  and the arts of different peoples,1
30, Walking is  an organic  an instinctive  function (not  of course  itself an  instinct)  speech is a non-instinctive  acquired  "cultural" function,1
49,    There is one fact that has frequently tended to prevent the recognition  of language as a merely conventional system of sound symbols  that has  seduced the popular mind into attributing to it an instinctive basis  that it does not really possess,1
45, This is the well-known observation that  under the stress of emotion  say of a sudden twinge of pain or of  unbridled joy  we do involuntarily give utterance to sounds that the  hearer interprets as indicative of the emotion itself,1
29, But there is all  the difference in the world between such involuntary expression of  feeling and the normal type of communication of ideas that is speech,1
63,  The former kind of utterance is indeed instinctive  but it is  non-symbolic  in other words  the sound of pain or the sound of joy does  not  as such  indicate the emotion  it does not stand aloof  as it were   and announce that such and such an emotion is being felt,1
34, What it does  is to serve as a more or less automatic overflow of the emotional  energy  in a sense  it is part and parcel of the emotion itself,1
15,  Moreover  such instinctive cries hardly constitute communication in any  strict sense,1
42, They are not addressed to any one  they are merely  overheard  if heard at all  as the bark of a dog  the sound of  approaching footsteps  or the rustling of the wind is heard,1
45, If they  convey certain ideas to the hearer  it is only in the very general sense  in which any and every sound or even any phenomenon in our environment  may be said to convey an idea to the perceiving mind,1
14, If the involuntary  cry of pain which is conventionally represented by "Oh,1
50," be looked upon  as a true speech symbol equivalent to some such idea as "I am in great  pain " it is just as allowable to interpret the appearance of clouds as  an equivalent symbol that carries the definite message "It is likely to  rain,1
23," A definition of language  however  that is so extended as to  cover every type of inference becomes utterly meaningless,1
18,    The mistake must not be made of identifying our conventional  interjections (our oh,1
3, and ah,1
3, and sh,1
7,) with the instinctive cries  themselves,1
12, These interjections are merely conventional fixations of the  natural sounds,1
20, They therefore differ widely in various languages in  accordance with the specific phonetic genius of each of these,1
72, As such  they may be considered an integral portion of speech  in the properly  cultural sense of the term  being no more identical with the instinctive  cries themselves than such words as "cuckoo" and "kill-deer" are  identical with the cries of the birds they denote or than Rossini's  treatment of a storm in the overture to "William Tell" is in fact a  storm,1
34, In other words  the interjections and sound-imitative words of  normal speech are related to their natural prototypes as is art  a  purely social or cultural thing  to nature,1
47, It may be objected that   though the interjections differ somewhat as we pass from language to  language  they do nevertheless offer striking family resemblances and  may therefore be looked upon as having grown up out of a common  instinctive base,1
21, But their case is nowise different from that  say  of  the varying national modes of pictorial representation,1
25, A Japanese  picture of a hill both differs from and resembles a typical modern  European painting of the same kind of hill,1
13, Both are suggested by and  both "imitate" the same natural feature,1
30, Neither the one nor the other  is the same thing as  or  in any intelligible sense  a direct outgrowth  of  this natural feature,1
25, The two modes of representation are not  identical because they proceed from differing historical traditions  are  executed with differing pictorial techniques,1
34, The interjections of  Japanese and English are  just so  suggested by a common natural  prototype  the instinctive cries  and are thus unavoidably suggestive of  each other,1
40, They differ  now greatly  now but little  because they are  builded out of historically diverse materials or techniques  the  respective linguistic traditions  phonetic systems  speech habits of the  two peoples,1
48, Yet the instinctive cries as such are practically identical  for all humanity  just as the human skeleton or nervous system is to all  intents and purposes a "fixed " that is  an only slightly and  "accidentally" variable  feature of man's organism,1
13,    Interjections are among the least important of speech elements,1
36, Their  discussion is valuable mainly because it can be shown that even they   avowedly the nearest of all language sounds to instinctive utterance   are only superficially of an instinctive nature,1
41, Were it therefore  possible to demonstrate that the whole of language is traceable  in its  ultimate historical and psychological foundations  to the interjections   it would still not follow that language is an instinctive activity,1
23, But   as a matter of fact  all attempts so to explain the origin of speech  have been fruitless,1
31, There is no tangible evidence  historical or  otherwise  tending to show that the mass of speech elements and speech  processes has evolved out of the interjections,1
50, These are a very small  and functionally insignificant proportion of the vocabulary of language   at no time and in no linguistic province that we have record of do we  see a noticeable tendency towards their elaboration into the primary  warp and woof of language,1
20, They are never more  at best  than a  decorative edging to the ample  complex fabric,1
19,    What applies to the interjections applies with even greater force to the  sound-imitative words,1
26, Such words as "whippoorwill " "to mew " "to caw"  are in no sense natural sounds that man has instinctively or  automatically reproduced,1
24, They are just as truly creations of the human  mind  flights of the human fancy  as anything else in language,1
21, They do  not directly grow out of nature  they are suggested by it and play with  it,1
49, Hence the onomatopoetic theory of the origin of speech  the theory  that would explain all speech as a gradual evolution from sounds of an  imitative character  really brings us no nearer to the instinctive level  than is language as we know it to-day,1
17, As to the theory itself  it is  scarcely more credible than its interjectional counterpart,1
43, It is true  that a number of words which we do not now feel to have a  sound-imitative value can be shown to have once had a phonetic form that  strongly suggests their origin as imitations of natural sounds,1
9, Such is  the English word "to laugh,1
49," For all that  it is quite impossible to  show  nor does it seem intrinsically reasonable to suppose  that more  than a negligible proportion of the elements of speech or anything at  all of its formal apparatus is derivable from an onomatopoetic source,1
49,  However much we may be disposed on general principles to assign a  fundamental importance in the languages of primitive peoples to the  imitation of natural sounds  the actual fact of the matter is that these  languages show no particular preference for imitative words,1
49, Among the  most primitive peoples of aboriginal America  the Athabaskan tribes of  the Mackenzie River speak languages in which such words seem to be  nearly or entirely absent  while they are used freely enough in  languages as sophisticated as English and German,1
22, Such an instance shows  how little the essential nature of speech is concerned with the mere  imitation of things,1
15,    The way is now cleared for a serviceable definition of language,1
29,  Language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating  ideas  emotions  and desires by means of a system of voluntarily  produced symbols,1
22, These symbols are  in the first instance  auditory and  they are produced by the so-called "organs of speech,1
59," There is no  discernible instinctive basis in human speech as such  however much  instinctive expressions and the natural environment may serve as a  stimulus for the development of certain elements of speech  however much  instinctive tendencies  motor and other  may give a predetermined range  or mold to linguistic expression,1
35, Such human or animal communication  if  "communication" it may be called  as is brought about by involuntary   instinctive cries is not  in our sense  language at all,1
40,    I have just referred to the "organs of speech " and it would seem at  first blush that this is tantamount to an admission that speech itself  is an instinctive  biologically predetermined activity,1
11, We must not be  misled by the mere term,1
28, There are  properly speaking  no organs of  speech  there are only organs that are incidentally useful in the  production of speech sounds,1
65, The lungs  the larynx  the palate  the  nose  the tongue  the teeth  and the lips  are all so utilized  but they  are no more to be thought of as primary organs of speech than are the  fingers to be considered as essentially organs of piano-playing or the  knees as organs of prayer,1
22, Speech is not a simple activity that is  carried on by one or more organs biologically adapted to the purpose,1
37, It  is an extremely complex and ever-shifting network of adjustments in the  brain  in the nervous system  and in the articulating and auditory  organs tending towards the desired end of communication,1
48, The lungs  developed  roughly speaking  in connection with the necessary  biological function known as breathing  the nose  as an organ of smell   the teeth  as organs useful in breaking up food before it was ready for  digestion,1
48, If  then  these and other organs are being constantly  utilized in speech  it is only because any organ  once existent and in  so far as it is subject to voluntary control  can be utilized by man for  secondary purposes,1
22, Physiologically  speech is an overlaid function  or   to be more precise  a group of overlaid functions,1
34, It gets what service  it can out of organs and functions  nervous and muscular  that have come  into being and are maintained for very different ends than its own,1
20,    It is true that physiological psychologists speak of the localization of  speech in the brain,1
102, This can only mean that the sounds of speech are  localized in the auditory tract of the brain  or in some circumscribed  portion of it  precisely as other classes of sounds are localized  and  that the motor processes involved in speech (such as the movements of  the glottal cords in the larynx  the movements of the tongue required to  pronounce the vowels  lip movements required to articulate certain  consonants  and numerous others) are localized in the motor tract  precisely as are all other impulses to special motor activities,1
27, In the  same way control is lodged in the visual tract of the brain over all  those processes of visual recognition involved in reading,1
79, Naturally the  particular points or clusters of points of localization in the several  tracts that refer to any element of language are connected in the brain  by paths of association  so that the outward  or psycho-physical  aspect  of language  is of a vast network of associated localizations in the  brain and lower nervous tracts  the auditory localizations being without  doubt the most fundamental of all for speech,1
40, However  a speechsound  localized in the brain  even when associated with the particular  movements of the "speech organs" that are required to produce it  is  very far from being an element of language,1
42, It must be further  associated with some element or group of elements of experience  say a  visual image or a class of visual images or a feeling of relation   before it has even rudimentary linguistic significance,1
61, This "element"  of experience is the content or "meaning" of the linguistic unit  the  associated auditory  motor  and other cerebral processes that lie  immediately back of the act of speaking and the act of hearing speech  are merely a complicated symbol of or signal for these "meanings " of  which more anon,1
65, We see therefore at once that language as such is not  and cannot be definitely localized  for it consists of a peculiar  symbolic relation physiologically an arbitrary one between all  possible elements of consciousness on the one hand and certain selected  elements localized in the auditory  motor  and other cerebral and  nervous tracts on the other,1
48, If language can be said to be definitely  "localized" in the brain  it is only in that general and rather useless  sense in which all aspects of consciousness  all human interest and  activity  may be said to be "in the brain,1
25," Hence  we have no recourse  but to accept language as a fully formed functional system within man's  psychic or "spiritual" constitution,1
28, We cannot define it as an entity in  psycho-physical terms alone  however much the psycho-physical basis is  essential to its functioning in the individual,1
39,    From the physiologist's or psychologist's point of view we may seem to  be making an unwarrantable abstraction in desiring to handle the subject  of speech without constant and explicit reference to that basis,1
9,  However  such an abstraction is justifiable,1
62, We can profitably discuss  the intention  the form  and the history of speech  precisely as we  discuss the nature of any other phase of human culture say art or  religion as an institutional or cultural entity  leaving the organic  and psychological mechanisms back of it as something to be taken for  granted,1
33, Accordingly  it must be clearly understood that this  introduction to the study of speech is not concerned with those aspects  of physiology and of physiological psychology that underlie speech,1
47, Our  study of language is not to be one of the genesis and operation of a  concrete mechanism  it is  rather  to be an inquiry into the function  and form of the arbitrary systems of symbolism that we term languages,1
39,    I have already pointed out that the essence of language consists in the  assigning of conventional  voluntarily articulated  sounds  or of their  equivalents  to the diverse elements of experience,1
114, The word "house" is  not a linguistic fact if by it is meant merely the acoustic effect  produced on the ear by its constituent consonants and vowels  pronounced  in a certain order  nor the motor processes and tactile feelings which  make up the articulation of the word  nor the visual perception on the  part of the hearer of this articulation  nor the visual perception of  the word "house" on the written or printed page  nor the motor processes  and tactile feelings which enter into the writing of the word  nor the  memory of any or all of these experiences,1
45, It is only when these  and  possibly still other  associated experiences are automatically  associated with the image of a house that they begin to take on the  nature of a symbol  a word  an element of language,1
13, But the mere fact of  such an association is not enough,1
43, One might have heard a particular  word spoken in an individual house under such impressive circumstances  that neither the word nor the image of the house ever recur in  consciousness without the other becoming present at the same time,1
10, This  type of association does not constitute speech,1
52, The association must be  a purely symbolic one  in other words  the word must denote  tag off   the image  must have no other significance than to serve as a counter to  refer to it whenever it is necessary or convenient to do so,1
26, Such an  association  voluntary and  in a sense  arbitrary as it is  demands a  considerable exercise of self-conscious attention,1
25, At least to begin  with  for habit soon makes the association nearly as automatic as any  and more rapid than most,1
12,    But we have traveled a little too fast,1
71, Were the symbol "house" whether  an auditory  motor  or visual experience or image attached but to the  single image of a particular house once seen  it might perhaps  by an  indulgent criticism  be termed an element of speech  yet it is obvious  at the outset that speech so constituted would have little or no value  for purposes of communication,1
43, The world of our experiences must be  enormously simplified and generalized before it is possible to make a  symbolic inventory of all our experiences of things and relations  and  this inventory is imperative before we can convey ideas,1
36, The elements of  language  the symbols that ticket off experience  must therefore be  associated with whole groups  delimited classes  of experience rather  than with the single experiences themselves,1
25, Only so is communication  possible  for the single experience lodges in an individual  consciousness and is  strictly speaking  incommunicable,1
24, To be  communicated it needs to be referred to a class which is tacitly  accepted by the community as an identity,1
26, Thus  the single impression  which I have had of a particular house must be identified with all my  other impressions of it,1
33, Further  my generalized memory or my "notion"  of this house must be merged with the notions that all other individuals  who have seen the house have formed of it,1
37, The particular experience  that we started with has now been widened so as to embrace all possible  impressions or images that sentient beings have formed or may form of  the house in question,1
32, This first simplification of experience is at the  bottom of a large number of elements of speech  the so-called proper  nouns or names of single individuals or objects,1
25, It is  essentially  the  type of simplification which underlies  or forms the crude subject of   history and art,1
17, But we cannot be content with this measure of reduction  of the infinity of experience,1
40, We must cut to the bone of things  we  must more or less arbitrarily throw whole masses of experience together  as similar enough to warrant their being looked upon mistakenly  but  conveniently as identical,1
43, This house and that house and thousands of  other phenomena of like character are thought of as having enough in  common  in spite of great and obvious differences of detail  to be  classed under the same heading,1
67, In other words  the speech element  "house" is the symbol  first and foremost  not of a single perception   nor even of the notion of a particular object  but of a "concept " in  other words  of a convenient capsule of thought that embraces thousands  of distinct experiences and that is ready to take in thousands more,1
37, If  the single significant elements of speech are the symbols of concepts   the actual flow of speech may be interpreted as a record of the setting  of these concepts into mutual relations,1
35,    The question has often been raised whether thought is possible without  speech  further  if speech and thought be not but two facets of the same  psychic process,1
17, The question is all the more difficult because it has  been hedged about by misunderstandings,1
36, In the first place  it is well  to observe that whether or not thought necessitates symbolism  that is  speech  the flow of language itself is not always indicative of thought,1
13,  We have seen that the typical linguistic element labels a concept,1
23, It  does not follow from this that the use to which language is put is  always or even mainly conceptual,1
23, We are not in ordinary life so much  concerned with concepts as such as with concrete particularities and  specific relations,1
54, When I say  for instance  "I had a good breakfast  this morning " it is clear that I am not in the throes of laborious  thought  that what I have to transmit is hardly more than a pleasurable  memory symbolically rendered in the grooves of habitual expression,1
31, Each  element in the sentence defines a separate concept or conceptual  relation or both combined  but the sentence as a whole has no conceptual  significance whatever,1
28, It is somewhat as though a dynamo capable of  generating enough power to run an elevator were operated almost  exclusively to feed an electric door-bell,1
12, The parallel is more  suggestive than at first sight appears,1
18, Language may be looked upon as  an instrument capable of running a gamut of psychic uses,1
60, Its flow not  only parallels that of the inner content of consciousness  but parallels  it on different levels  ranging from the state of mind that is dominated  by particular images to that in which abstract concepts and their  relations are alone at the focus of attention and which is ordinarily  termed reasoning,1
47, Thus the outward form only of language is constant   its inner meaning  its psychic value or intensity  varies freely with  attention or the selective interest of the mind  also  needless to say   with the mind's general development,1
51, From the point of view of  language  thought may be defined as the highest latent or potential  content of speech  the content that is obtained by interpreting each of  the elements in the flow of language as possessed of its very fullest  conceptual value,1
16, From this it follows at once that language and thought  are not strictly coterminous,1
25, At best language can but be the outward  facet of thought on the highest  most generalized  level of symbolic  expression,1
15, To put our viewpoint somewhat differently  language is  primarily a pre-rational function,1
50, It humbly works up to the thought  that is latent in  that may eventually be read into  its classifications  and its forms  it is not  as is generally but na 'efvely assumed  the final  label put upon  the finished thought,1
32,    Most people  asked if they can think without speech  would probably  answer  "Yes  but it is not easy for me to do so,1
9, Still I know it can be  done,1
6," Language is but a garment,1
18, But what if language is not so much a  garment as a prepared road or groove,1
39, It is  indeed  in the highest  degree likely that language is an instrument originally put to uses  lower than the conceptual plane and that thought arises as a refined  interpretation of its content,1
46, The product grows  in other words  with  the instrument  and thought may be no more conceivable  in its genesis  and daily practice  without speech than is mathematical reasoning  practicable without the lever of an appropriate mathematical symbolism,1
48,  No one believes that even the most difficult mathematical proposition is  inherently dependent on an arbitrary set of symbols  but it is  impossible to suppose that the human mind is capable of arriving at or  holding such a proposition without the symbolism,1
35, The writer  for one   is strongly of the opinion that the feeling entertained by so many that  they can think  or even reason  without language is an illusion,1
13, The  illusion seems to be due to a number of factors,1
15, The simplest of these  is the failure to distinguish between imagery and thought,1
35, As a matter  of fact  no sooner do we try to put an image into conscious relation  with another than we find ourselves slipping into a silent flow of  words,1
33, Thought may be a natural domain apart from the artificial one of  speech  but speech would seem to be the only road we know of that leads  to it,1
35, A still more fruitful source of the illusive feeling that  language may be dispensed with in thought is the common failure to  realize that language is not identical with its auditory symbolism,1
83, The  auditory symbolism may be replaced  point for point  by a motor or by a  visual symbolism (many people can read  for instance  in a purely visual  sense  that is  without the intermediating link of an inner flow of the  auditory images that correspond to the printed or written words) or by  still other  more subtle and elusive  types of transfer that are not so  easy to define,1
31, Hence the contention that one thinks without language  merely because he is not aware of a coexisting auditory imagery is very  far indeed from being a valid one,1
62, One may go so far as to suspect that  the symbolic expression of thought may in some cases run along outside  the fringe of the conscious mind  so that the feeling of a free   nonlinguistic stream of thought is for minds of a certain type a  relatively  but only a relatively  justified one,1
57, Psycho-physically   this would mean that the auditory or equivalent visual or motor centers  in the brain  together with the appropriate paths of association  that  are the cerebral equivalent of speech  are touched off so lightly during  the process of thought as not to rise into consciousness at all,1
29, This  would be a limiting case thought riding lightly on the submerged crests  of speech  instead of jogging along with it  hand in hand,1
19, The modern  psychology has shown us how powerfully symbolism is at work in the  unconscious mind,1
38, It is therefore easier to understand at the present  time than it would have been twenty years ago that the most rarefied  thought may be but the conscious counterpart of an unconscious  linguistic symbolism,1
15,    One word more as to the relation between language and thought,1
36, The point  of view that we have developed does not by any means preclude the  possibility of the growth of speech being in a high degree dependent on  the development of thought,1
56, We may assume that language arose  pre-rationally just how and on what precise level of mental activity we  do not know but we must not imagine that a highly developed system of  speech symbols worked itself out before the genesis of distinct concepts  and of thinking  the handling of concepts,1
53, We must rather imagine that  thought processes set in  as a kind of psychic overflow  almost at the  beginning of linguistic expression  further  that the concept  once  defined  necessarily reacted on the life of its linguistic symbol   encouraging further linguistic growth,1
21, We see this complex process of  the interaction of language and thought actually taking place under our  eyes,1
14, The instrument makes possible the product  the product refines the  instrument,1
45, The birth of a new concept is invariably foreshadowed by a  more or less strained or extended use of old linguistic material  the  concept does not attain to individual and independent life until it has  found a distinctive linguistic embodiment,1
28, In most cases the new symbol  is but a thing wrought from linguistic material already in existence in  ways mapped out by crushingly despotic precedents,1
32, As soon as the word  is at hand  we instinctively feel  with something of a sigh of relief   that the concept is ours for the handling,1
26, Not until we own the symbol  do we feel that we hold a key to the immediate knowledge or  understanding of the concept,1
27, Would we be so ready to die for "liberty "  to struggle for "ideals " if the words themselves were not ringing  within us,1
22, And the word  as we know  is not only a key  it may also be a  fetter,1
12,    Language is primarily an auditory system of symbols,1
29, In so far as it is  articulated it is also a motor system  but the motor aspect of speech is  clearly secondary to the auditory,1
33, In normal individuals the impulse to  speech first takes effect in the sphere of auditory imagery and is then  transmitted to the motor nerves that control the organs of speech,1
23, The  motor processes and the accompanying motor feelings are not  however   the end  the final resting point,1
19, They are merely a means and a control  leading to auditory perception in both speaker and hearer,1
39,  Communication  which is the very object of speech  is successfully  effected only when the hearer's auditory perceptions are translated into  the appropriate and intended flow of imagery or thought or both  combined,1
31, Hence the cycle of speech  in so far as we may look upon it as  a purely external instrument  begins and ends in the realm of sounds,1
29,  The concordance between the initial auditory imagery and the final  auditory perceptions is the social seal or warrant of the successful  issue of the process,1
32, As we have already seen  the typical course of  this process may undergo endless modifications or transfers into  equivalent systems without thereby losing its essential formal  characteristics,1
21,    The most important of these modifications is the abbreviation of the  speech process involved in thinking,1
20, This has doubtless many forms   according to the structural or functional peculiarities of the  individual mind,1
17, The least modified form is that known as "talking to  one's self" or "thinking aloud,1
24," Here the speaker and the hearer are  identified in a single person  who may be said to communicate with  himself,1
21, More significant is the still further abbreviated form in which  the sounds of speech are not articulated at all,1
15, To this belong all the  varieties of silent speech and of normal thinking,1
85, The auditory centers  alone may be excited  or the impulse to linguistic expression may be  communicated as well to the motor nerves that communicate with the  organs of speech but be inhibited either in the muscles of these organs  or at some point in the motor nerves themselves  or  possibly  the  auditory centers may be only slightly  if at all  affected  the speech  process manifesting itself directly in the motor sphere,1
10, There must be  still other types of abbreviation,1
52, How common is the excitation of the  motor nerves in silent speech  in which no audible or visible  articulations result  is shown by the frequent experience of fatigue in  the speech organs  particularly in the larynx  after unusually  stimulating reading or intensive thinking,1
21,    All the modifications so far considered are directly patterned on the  typical process of normal speech,1
32, Of very great interest and importance  is the possibility of transferring the whole system of speech symbolism  into other terms than those that are involved in the typical process,1
24,  This process  as we have seen  is a matter of sounds and of movements  intended to produce these sounds,1
11, The sense of vision is not brought  into play,1
28, But let us suppose that one not only hears the articulated  sounds but sees the articulations themselves as they are being executed  by the speaker,1
57, Clearly  if one can only gain a sufficiently high degree  of adroitness in perceiving these movements of the speech organs  the  way is opened for a new type of speech symbolism that in which the  sound is replaced by the visual image of the articulations that  correspond to the sound,1
45, This sort of system has no great value for most  of us because we are already possessed of the auditory-motor system of  which it is at best but an imperfect translation  not all the  articulations being visible to the eye,1
27, However  it is well known what  excellent use deaf-mutes can make of "reading from the lips" as a  subsidiary method of apprehending speech,1
55, The most important of all  visual speech symbolisms is  of course  that of the written or printed  word  to which  on the motor side  corresponds the system of delicately  adjusted movements which result in the writing or typewriting or other  graphic method of recording speech,1
60, The significant feature for our  recognition in these new types of symbolism  apart from the fact that  they are no longer a by-product of normal speech itself  is that each  element (letter or written word) in the system corresponds to a specific  element (sound or sound-group or spoken word) in the primary system,1
21,  Written language is thus a point-to-point equivalence  to borrow a  mathematical phrase  to its spoken counterpart,1
57, The written forms are  secondary symbols of the spoken ones symbols of symbols yet so close  is the correspondence that they may  not only in theory but in the  actual practice of certain eye-readers and  possibly  in certain types  of thinking  be entirely substituted for the spoken ones,1
24, Yet the  auditory-motor associations are probably always latent at the least   that is  they are unconsciously brought into play,1
25, Even those who read  and think without the slightest use of sound imagery are  at last  analysis  dependent on it,1
32, They are merely handling the circulating  medium  the money  of visual symbols as a convenient substitute for the  economic goods and services of the fundamental auditory symbols,1
12,    The possibilities of linguistic transfer are practically unlimited,1
32, A  familiar example is the Morse telegraph code  in which the letters of  written speech are represented by a conventionally fixed sequence of  longer or shorter ticks,1
20, Here the transfer takes place from the written  word rather than directly from the sounds of spoken speech,1
18, The letter  of the telegraph code is thus a symbol of a symbol of a symbol,1
55, It does  not  of course  in the least follow that the skilled operator  in order  to arrive at an understanding of a telegraphic message  needs to  transpose the individual sequence of ticks into a visual image of the  word before he experiences its normal auditory image,1
20, The precise method  of reading off speech from the telegraphic communication undoubtedly  varies widely with the individual,1
77, It is even conceivable  if not  exactly likely  that certain operators may have learned to think  directly  so far as the purely conscious part of the process of thought  is concerned  in terms of the tick-auditory symbolism or  if they happen  to have a strong natural bent toward motor symbolism  in terms of the  correlated tactile-motor symbolism developed in the sending of  telegraphic messages,1
51,    Still another interesting group of transfers are the different gesture  languages  developed for the use of deaf-mutes  of Trappist monks vowed  to perpetual silence  or of communicating parties that are within seeing  distance of each other but are out of earshot,1
68, Some of these systems are  one-to-one equivalences of the normal system of speech  others  like  military gesture-symbolism or the gesture language of the Plains Indians  of North America (understood by tribes of mutually unintelligible forms  of speech) are imperfect transfers  limiting themselves to the rendering  of such grosser speech elements as are an imperative minimum under  difficult circumstances,1
57, In these latter systems  as in such still more  imperfect symbolisms as those used at sea or in the woods  it may be  contended that language no longer properly plays a part but that the  ideas are directly conveyed by an utterly unrelated symbolic process or  by a quasi-instinctive imitativeness,1
8, Such an interpretation would be  erroneous,1
30, The intelligibility of these vaguer symbolisms can hardly be  due to anything but their automatic and silent translation into the  terms of a fuller flow of speech,1
56,    We shall no doubt conclude that all voluntary communication of ideas   aside from normal speech  is either a transfer  direct or indirect  from  the typical symbolism of language as spoken and heard or  at the least   involves the intermediary of truly linguistic symbolism,1
10, This is a fact  of the highest importance,1
35, Auditory imagery and the correlated motor  imagery leading to articulation are  by whatever devious ways we follow  the process  the historic fountain-head of all speech and of all  thinking,1
9, One other point is of still greater importance,1
60, The ease with  which speech symbolism can be transferred from one sense to another   from technique to technique  itself indicates that the mere sounds of  speech are not the essential fact of language  which lies rather in the  classification  in the formal patterning  and in the relating of  concepts,1
20, Once more  language  as a structure  is on its inner face the  mold of thought,1
25, It is this abstracted language  rather more than the  physical facts of speech  that is to concern us in our inquiry,1
17,    There is no more striking general fact about language than its  universality,1
42, One may argue as to whether a particular tribe engages in  activities that are worthy of the name of religion or of art  but we  know of no people that is not possessed of a fully developed language,1
31,  The lowliest South African Bushman speaks in the forms of a rich  symbolic system that is in essence perfectly comparable to the speech of  the cultivated Frenchman,1
43, It goes without saying that the more abstract  concepts are not nearly so plentifully represented in the language of  the savage  nor is there the rich terminology and the finer definition  of nuances that reflect the higher culture,1
38, Yet the sort of linguistic  development that parallels the historic growth of culture and which  in  its later stages  we associate with literature is  at best  but a  superficial thing,1
54, The fundamental groundwork of language the  development of a clear-cut phonetic system  the specific association of  speech elements with concepts  and the delicate provision for the formal  expression of all manner of relations all this meets us rigidly  perfected and systematized in every language known to us,1
27, Many primitive  languages have a formal richness  a latent luxuriance of expression   that eclipses anything known to the languages of modern civilization,1
21,  Even in the mere matter of the inventory of speech the layman must be  prepared for strange surprises,1
21, Popular statements as to the extreme  poverty of expression to which primitive languages are doomed are simply  myths,1
15, Scarcely less impressive than the universality of speech is its  almost incredible diversity,1
31, Those of us that have studied French or  German  or  better yet  Latin or Greek  know in what varied forms a  thought may run,1
32, The formal divergences between the English plan and the  Latin plan  however  are comparatively slight in the perspective of what  we know of more exotic linguistic patterns,1
14, The universality and the  diversity of speech lead to a significant inference,1
37, We are forced to  believe that language is an immensely ancient heritage of the human  race  whether or not all forms of speech are the historical outgrowth of  a single pristine form,1
34, It is doubtful if any other cultural asset of  man  be it the art of drilling for fire or of chipping stone  may lay  claim to a greater age,1
44, I am inclined to believe that it antedated even  the lowliest developments of material culture  that these developments   in fact  were not strictly possible until language  the tool of  significant expression  had itself taken shape,1

10, THE SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE ONE OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES,2
37,      When I was asked some time ago to deliver a course of lectures on  Comparative Philology in this Institution  I at once expressed my  readiness to do so,2
64, I had lived long enough in England to know that the  peculiar difficulties arising from my imperfect knowledge of the language  would be more than balanced by the forbearance of an English audience  and  I had such perfect faith in my subject that I thought it might be trusted  even in the hands of a less skilful expositor,2
98, I felt convinced that the  researches into the history of languages and into the nature of human  speech which have been carried on for the last fifty years in England   France  and Germany  deserved a larger share of public sympathy than they  had hitherto received  and it seemed to me  as far as I could judge  that  the discoveries in this newly-opened mine of scientific inquiry were not  inferior  whether in novelty or importance  to the most brilliant  discoveries of our age,2
28,    It was not till I began to write my lectures that I became aware of the  difficulties of the task I had undertaken,2
107, The dimensions of the science  of language are so vast that it is impossible in a course of nine lectures  to give more than a very general survey of it  and as one of the greatest  charms of this science consists in the minuteness of the analysis by which  each language  each dialect  each word  each grammatical form is tested  I  felt that it was almost impossible to do full justice to my subject  or to  place the achievements of those who founded and fostered the science of  language in their true light,2
19, Another difficulty arises from the dryness  of many of the problems which I shall have to discuss,2
33, Declensions and  conjugations cannot be made amusing  nor can I avail myself of the  advantages possessed by most lecturers  who enliven their discussions by  experiments and diagrams,2
106, If  with all these difficulties and drawbacks  I  do not shrink from opening to-day this course of lectures on mere words   on nouns and verbs and particles  '97if I venture to address an audience  accustomed to listen  in this place  to the wonderful tales of the natural  historian  the chemist  and geologist  and wont to see the novel results  of inductive reasoning invested by native eloquence  with all the charms  of poetry and romance  '97it is because  though mistrusting myself  I cannot  mistrust my subject,2
53, The study of words may be tedious to the school-boy   as breaking of stones is to the wayside laborer  but to the thoughtful eye  of the geologist these stones are full of interest  '97he sees miracles on  the high-road  and reads chronicles in every ditch,2
24, Language  too  has  marvels of her own  which she unveils to the inquiring glance of the  patient student,2
15, There are chronicles below her surface  there are sermons  in every word,2
16, Language has been called sacred ground  because it is the  deposit of thought,2
9, We cannot tell as yet what language is,2
20, It may be a  production of nature  a work of human art  or a divine gift,2
24, But to  whatever sphere it belongs  it would seem to stand unsurpassed '97nay   unequalled in it '97by anything else,2
23, If it be a production of nature  it is  her last and crowning production which she reserved for man alone,2
28, If it  be a work of human art  it would seem to lift the human artist almost to  the level of a divine creator,2
37, If it be the gift of God  it is God '92s  greatest gift  for through it God spake to man and man speaks to God in  worship  prayer  and meditation,2
72,    Although the way which is before us may be long and tedious  the point to  which it tends would seem to be full of interest  and I believe I may  promise that the view opened before our eyes from the summit of our  science  will fully repay the patient travellers  and perhaps secure a  free pardon to their venturous guide,2
149,                       uc0                                                                                                                   The Science of Language is a science of very modern date,2
35, We cannot trace  its lineage much beyond the beginning of our century  and it is scarcely  received as yet on a footing of equality by the elder branches of  learning,2
56, Its very name is still unsettled  and the various titles that  have been given to it in England  France  and Germany are so vague and  varying that they have led to the most confused ideas among the public at  large as to the real objects of this new science,2
18, We hear it spoken of as  Comparative Philology  Scientific Etymology  Phonology  and Glossology,2
18, In  France it has received the convenient  but somewhat barbarous  name of  _Linguistique_,2
28, If we must have a Greek title for our science  we might  derive it either from _mythos_  word  or from _logos_  speech,2
21, But the  title of _Mythology_ is already occupied  and _Logology_ would jar too  much on classical ears,2
70, We need not waste our time in criticising these  names  as none of them has as yet received that universal sanction which  belongs to the titles of other modern sciences  such as Geology or  Comparative Anatomy  nor will there be much difficulty in christening our  young science after we have once ascertained its birth  its parentage  and  its character,2
32, I myself prefer the simple designation of the Science of  Language  though in these days of high-sounding titles  this plain name  will hardly meet with general acceptance,2
16,    From the name we now turn to the meaning of our science,2
75, But before we  enter upon a definition of its subject-matter  and determine the method  which ought to be followed in our researches  it will be useful to cast a  glance at the history of the other sciences  among which the science of  language now  for the first time  claims her place  and examine their  origin  their gradual progress  and definite settlement,2
69, The history of a  science is  as it were  its biography  and as we buy experience cheapest  in studying the lives of others  we may  perhaps  guard our young science  from some of the follies and extravagances inherent in youth by learning a  lesson for which other branches of human knowledge have had to pay more  dearly,2
15,    There is a certain uniformity in the history of most sciences,2
48, If we read  such works as Whewell '92s History of the Inductive Sciences or Humboldt '92s  Cosmos  we find that the origin  the progress  the causes of failure and  success have been the same for almost every branch of human knowledge,2
33,  There are three marked periods or stages in the history of every one of  them  which we may call the _Empirical_  the _Classificatory_  and the  _Theoretical_,2
35, However humiliating it may sound  every one of our  sciences  however grand their present titles  can be traced back to the  most humble and homely occupations of half-savage tribes,2
26, It was not the  true  the good  and the beautiful which spurred the early philosophers to  deep researches and bold discoveries,2
29, The foundation-stone of the most  glorious structures of human ingenuity in ages to come was supplied by the  pressing wants of a patriarchal and semi-barbarous society,2
19, The names of  some of the most ancient departments of human knowledge tell their own  tale,2
68, Geometry  which at present declares itself free from all sensuous  impressions  and treats of its points and lines and planes as purely ideal  conceptions  not to be confounded with those coarse and imperfect  representations as they appear on paper to the human eye  geometry  as its  very name declares  began with measuring a garden or a field,2
23, It is  derived from the Greek _g uc0 u275 _  land  ground  earth  and _metron_  measure,2
40,  Botany  the science of plants  was originally the science of _botan uc0 u275 _   which in Greek does not mean a plant in general  but fodder  from  _boskein_  to feed,2
19, The science of plants would have been called  Phytology  from the Greek _phyton_  a plant,2
20,(1) The founders of Astronomy  were not the poet or the philosopher  but the sailor and the farmer,2
53, The  early poet may have admired  '93the mazy dance of planets  '94 and the  philosopher may have speculated on the heavenly harmonies  but it was to  the sailor alone that a knowledge of the glittering guides of heaven  became a question of life and death,2
54, It was he who calculated their  risings and settings with the accuracy of a merchant and the shrewdness of  an adventurer  and the names that were given to single stars or  constellations clearly show that they were invented by the ploughers of  the sea and of the land,2
58, The moon  for instance  the golden hand on the  dark dial of heaven  was called by them the Measurer  '97the measurer of  time  for time was measured by nights  and moons  and winters  long before  it was reckoned by days  and suns  and years,2
7, Moon(2) is a very old word,2
64,  It was _m 'f4na_ in Anglo-Saxon  and was used there  not as a feminine  but  as a masculine  for the moon was a masculine in all Teutonic languages   and it is only through the influence of classical models that in English  moon has been changed into a feminine  and sun into a masculine,2
10, It was a  most unlucky assertion which Mr,2
26, Harris made in his _Hermes_  that all  nations ascribe to the sun a masculine  and to the moon a feminine  gender,2
11,(3) In Gothic moon is _mena_  which is a masculine,2
8, For month we  have in A,2
1,-S,2
11, _m 'f3n 'e2dh_  in Gothic _menoth_  both masculine,2
29, In Greek we  find _m uc0 u275 n_  a masculine  for month  and _m u275 n u275 _  a feminine  for moon,2
31, In  Latin we have the derivative _mensis_  month  and in Sanskrit we find  _m 'e2s_ for moon  and _m 'e2sa_ for month  both masculine,2
22,(4) Now this _m 'e2s_ in  Sanskrit is clearly derived from a root _m 'e2_  to measure  to mete,2
26, In  Sanskrit  I measure is _m 'e2-mi_  thou measurest  _m 'e2-si_  he measures   _m 'e2-ti_ (or _mim 'ee-te_),2
19, An instrument of measuring is called in Sanskrit  _m 'e2-tram_  the Greek _metron_  our metre,2
80, Now if the moon was originally  called by the farmer the measurer  the ruler of days  and weeks  and  seasons  the regulator of the tides  the lord of their festivals  and the  herald of their public assemblies  it is but natural that he should have  been conceived as a man  and not as the love-sick maiden which our modern  sentimental poetry has put in his place,2
48,    It was the sailor who  before intrusting his life and goods to the winds  and the waves of the ocean  watched for the rising of those stars which he  called the Sailing-stars or _Pleiades_  from _plein_  to sail,2
24, Navigation  in the Greek waters was considered safe after the return of the Pleiades   and it closed when they disappeared,2
19, The Latin name for the _Pleiades_ is  _Vergili 'e6_  from _virga_  a sprout or twig,2
31, This name was given to them by  the Italian husbandman  because in Italy  where they became visible about  May  they marked the return of summer,2
43,(5) Another constellation  the seven  stars in the head of Taurus  received the name of _Hyades_ or _Pluvi 'e6_ in  Latin  because at the time when they rose with the sun they were supposed  to announce rain,2
106, The astronomer retains these and many other names  he  still speaks of the pole of heaven  of wandering and fixed stars (6) but  he is apt to forget that these terms were not the result of scientific  observation and classification  but were borrowed from the language of  those who themselves were wanderers on the sea or in the desert  and to  whom the fixed stars were in full reality what their name implies  stars  driven in and fixed  by which they might hold fast on the deep  as by  heavenly anchors,2
84,    But although historically we are justified in saying that the first  geometrician was a ploughman  the first botanist a gardener  the first  mineralogist a miner  it may reasonably be objected that in this early  stage a science is hardly a science yet: that measuring a field is not  geometry  that growing cabbages is very far from botany  and that a  butcher has no claim to the title of comparative anatomist,2
39, This is  perfectly true  yet it is but right that each science should be reminded  of these its more humble beginnings  and of the practical requirements  which it was originally intended to answer,2
28, A science  as Bacon says   should be a rich storehouse for the glory of God  and the relief of man '92s  estate,2
91, Now  although it may seem as if in the present high state of our  society students were enabled to devote their time to the investigation of  the facts and laws of nature  or to the contemplation of the mysteries of  the world of thought  without any side-glance at the practical result of  their labors  no science and no art have long prospered and flourished  among us  unless they were in some way subservient to the practical  interests of society,2
43, It is true that a Lyell collects and arranges  a  Faraday weighs and analyzes  an Owen dissects and compares  a Herschel  observes and calculates  without any thought of the immediate marketable  results of their labors,2
33, But there is a general interest which supports  and enlivens their researches  and that interest depends on the practical  advantages which society at large derives from their scientific studies,2
68,  Let it be known that the successive strata of the geologist are a  deception to the miner  that the astronomical tables are useless to the  navigator  that chemistry is nothing but an expensive amusement  of no use  to the manufacturer and the farmer '97and astronomy  chemistry  and geology  would soon share the fate of alchemy and astrology,2
85, As long as the  Egyptian science excited the hopes of the invalid by mysterious  prescriptions (I may observe by the way that the hieroglyphic signs of our  modern prescriptions have been traced back by Champollion to the real  hieroglyphics of Egypt(7)) '97and as long as it instigated the avarice of its  patrons by the promise of the discovery of gold  it enjoyed a liberal  support at the courts of princes  and under the roofs of monasteries,2
22,  Though alchemy did not lead to the discovery of gold  it prepared the way  to discoveries more valuable,2
5, The same with astrology,2
16, Astrology was not  such mere imposition as it is generally supposed to have been,2
51, It is  counted as a science by so sound and sober a scholar as Melancthon  and  even Bacon allows it a place among the sciences  though admitting that  '93it  had better intelligence and confederacy with the imagination of man than  with his reason,2
55, '94 In spite of the strong condemnation which Luther  pronounced against astrology  astrology continued to sway the destinies of  Europe  and a hundred years after Luther  the astrologer was the  counsellor of princes and generals  while the founder of modern astronomy  died in poverty and despair,2
14, In our time the very rudiments of astrology  are lost and forgotten,2
32,(8) Even real and useful arts  as soon as they  cease to be useful  die away  and their secrets are sometimes lost beyond  the hope of recovery,2
59, When after the Reformation our churches and chapels  were divested of their artistic ornaments  in order to restore  in outward  appearance also  the simplicity and purity of the Christian church  the  colors of the painted windows began to fade away  and have never regained  their former depth and harmony,2
56, The invention of printing gave the  death-blow to the art of ornamental writing and of miniature-painting  employed in the illumination of manuscripts  and the best artists of the  present day despair of rivalling the minuteness  softness  and brilliancy  combined by the humble manufacturer of the medi 'e6val missal,2
43,    I speak somewhat feelingly on the necessity that every science should  answer some practical purpose  because I am aware that the science of  language has but little to offer to the utilitarian spirit of our age,2
33, It  does not profess to help us in learning languages more expeditiously  nor  does it hold out any hope of ever realizing the dream of one universal  language,2
33, It simply professes to teach what language is  and this would  hardly seem sufficient to secure for a new science the sympathy and  support of the public at large,2
35, There are problems  however  which  though  apparently of an abstruse and merely speculative character  have exercised  a powerful influence for good or evil in the history of mankind,2
48, Men  before now have fought for an idea  and have laid down their lives for a  word  and many of these problems which have agitated the world from the  earliest to our own times  belong properly to the science of language,2
23,    Mythology  which was the bane of the ancient world  is in truth a disease  of language,2
30, A myth means a word  but a word which  from being a name or  an attribute  has been allowed to assume a more substantial existence,2
40,  Most of the Greek  the Roman  the Indian  and other heathen gods are  nothing but poetical names  which were gradually allowed to assume a  divine personality never contemplated by their original inventors,2
25, _Eos_  was a name of the dawn before she became a goddess  the wife of  _Tithonos_  or the dying day,2
50, _Fatum_  or fate  meant originally what had  been spoken  and before Fate became a power  even greater than Jupiter  it  meant that which had once been spoken by Jupiter  and could never be  changed  '97not even by Jupiter himself,2
71, _Zeus_ originally meant the bright  heaven  in Sanskrit _Dyaus_  and many of the stories told of him as the  supreme god  had a meaning only as told originally of the bright heaven   whose rays  like golden rain  descend on the lap of the earth  the _Danae_  of old  kept by her father in the dark prison of winter,2
29, No one doubts  that _Luna_ was simply a name of the moon  but so was likewise _Lucina_   both derived from _lucere_  to shine,2
51, _Hecate_  too  was an old name of  the moon  the feminine of _Hekatos_ and _Hekatebolos_  the far-darting  sun  and _Pyrrha_  the Eve of the Greeks  was nothing but a name of the  red earth  and in particular of Thessaly,2
18, This mythological disease   though less virulent in modern languages  is by no means extinct,2
80,    During the Middle Ages the controversy between Nominalism and Realism   which agitated the church for centuries  and finally prepared the way for  the Reformation  was again  as its very name shows  a controversy on  names  on the nature of language  and on the relation of words to our  conceptions on one side  and to the realities of the outer world on the  other,2
31, Men were called heretics for believing that words such as _justice_  or _truth_ expressed only conceptions of our mind  not real things walking  about in broad daylight,2
27,    In modern times the science of language has been called in to settle some  of the most perplexing political and social questions,2
68,  '93Nations and  languages against dynasties and treaties  '94 this is what has remodelled   and will remodel still more  the map of Europe  and in America comparative  philologists have been encouraged to prove the impossibility of a common  origin of languages and races  in order to justify  by scientific  arguments  the unhallowed theory of slavery,2
51, Never do I remember to have  seen science more degraded than on the title-page of an American  publication in which  among the profiles of the different races of man   the profile of the ape was made to look more human than that of the negro,2
42,    Lastly  the problem of the position of man on the threshold between the  worlds of matter and spirit has of late assumed a very marked prominence  among the problems of the physical and mental sciences,2
139, It has absorbed  the thoughts of men who  after a long life spent in collecting  observing   and analyzing  have brought to its solution qualifications unrivalled in  any previous age  and if we may judge from the greater warmth displayed in  discussions ordinarily conducted with the calmness of judges and not with  the passion of pleaders  it might seem  after all  as if the great  problems of our being  of the true nobility of our blood  of our descent  from heaven or earth  though unconnected with anything that is commonly  called practical  have still retained a charm of their own '97a charm that  will never lose its power on the mind  and on the heart of man,2
60, Now   however much the frontiers of the animal kingdom have been pushed forward   so that at one time the line of demarcation between animal and man seemed  to depend on a mere fold in the brain  there is _one_ barrier which no one  has yet ventured to touch '97the barrier of language,2
56, Even those philosophers  with whom _penser c '92est sentir_ (9) who reduce all thought to feeling  and  maintain that we share the faculties which are the productive causes of  thought in common with beasts  are bound to confess that _as yet_ no race  of animals has produced a language,2
58, Lord Monboddo  for instance  admits  that as yet no animal has been discovered in the possession of language    '93not even the beaver  who of all the animals we know  that are not  like  the orang-outangs  of our own species  comes nearest to us in sagacity,2
58, '94    Locke  who is generally classed together with these materialistic  philosophers  and who certainly vindicated a large share of what had been  claimed for the intellect as the property of the senses  recognized most  fully the barrier which language  as such  placed between man and brutes,2
47,   '93This I may be positive in  '94 he writes   '93that the power of abstracting is  not at all in brutes  and that the having of general ideas is that which  puts a perfect distinction between man and brutes,2
57, For it is evident we  observe no footsteps in these of making use of general signs for universal  ideas  from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty  of abstracting or making general ideas  since they have no use of _words_  or any other general signs,2
106, '94    If  therefore  the science of language gives us an insight into that  which  by common consent  distinguishes man from all other living beings   if it establishes a frontier between man and the brute  which can never be  removed  it would seem to possess at the present moment peculiar claims on  the attention of all who  while watching with sincere admiration the  progress of comparative physiology  yet consider it their duty to enter  their manly protest against a revival of the shallow theories of Lord  Monboddo,2
17,    But to return to our survey of the history of the physical sciences,2
15, We  had examined the empirical stage through which every science has to pass,2
76,  We saw that  for instance  in botany  a man who has travelled through  distant countries  who has collected a vast number of plants  who knows  their names  their peculiarities  and their medicinal qualities  is not  yet a botanist  but only a herbalist  a lover of plants  or what the  Italians call a _dilettante_  from _dilettare_  to delight,2
20, The real  science of plants  like every other science  begins with the work of  classification,2
33, An empirical acquaintance with facts rises to a scientific  knowledge of facts as soon as the mind discovers beneath the multiplicity  of single productions the unity of an organic system,2
12, This discovery is  made by means of comparison and classification,2
48, We cease to study each  flower for its own sake  and by continually enlarging the sphere of our  observation  we try to discover what is common to many and offers those  essential points on which groups or natural classes may be established,2
50,  These classes again  in their more general features  are mutually  compared  new points of difference  or of similarity of a more general and  higher character  spring to view  and enable us to discover classes of  classes  or families,2
71, And when the whole kingdom of plants has thus been  surveyed  and a simple tissue of names been thrown over the garden of  nature  when we can lift it up  as it were  and view it in our mind as a  whole  as a system well defined and complete  we then speak of the science  of plants  or botany,2
60, We have entered into altogether a new sphere of  knowledge where the individual is subject to the general  fact to law  we  discover thought  order  and purpose pervading the whole realm of nature   and we perceive the dark chaos of matter lighted up by the reflection of a  divine mind,2
8, Such views may be right or wrong,2
29, Too hasty comparisons  or  too narrow distinctions  may have prevented the eye of the observer from  discovering the broad outlines of nature '92s plan,2
18, Yet every system  however  insufficient it may prove hereafter  is a step in advance,2
71, If the mind of  man is once impressed with the conviction that there must be order and law  everywhere  it never rests again until all that seems irregular has been  eliminated  until the full beauty and harmony of nature has been  perceived  and the eye of man has caught the eye of God beaming out from  the midst of all His works,2
13, The failures of the past prepare the triumphs  of the future,2
57,    Thus  to recur to our former illustration  the systematic arrangement of  plants which bears the name of Linn 'e6us  and which is founded on the number  and character of the reproductive organs  failed to bring out the natural  order which pervades all that grows and blossoms,2
24, Broad lines of  demarcation which unite or divide large tribes and families of plants were  invisible from his point of view,2
14, But in spite of this  his work was not  in vain,2
62, The fact that plants in every part of the world belonged to one  great system was established once for all  and even in later systems most  of his classes and divisions have been preserved  because the conformation  of the reproductive organs of plants happened to run parallel with other  more characteristic marks of true affinity,2
11,(10) It is the same in the  history of astronomy,2
33, Although the Ptolem 'e6an system was a wrong one  yet  even from its eccentric point of view  laws were discovered determining  the true movements of the heavenly bodies,2
20, The conviction that there  remains something unexplained is sure to lead to the discovery of our  error,2
15, There can be no error in nature  the error must be with us,2
61, This  conviction lived in the heart of Aristotle when  in spite of his imperfect  knowledge of nature  he declared  '93that there is in nature nothing  interpolated or without connection  as in a bad tragedy  '94 and from his  time forward every new fact and every new system have confirmed his faith,2
10,    The object of classification is clear,2
60, We understand things if we can  comprehend them  that is to say  if we can grasp and hold together single  facts  connect isolated impressions  distinguish between what is essential  and what is merely accidental  and thus predicate the general of the  individual  and class the individual under the general,2
10, This is the secret  of all scientific knowledge,2
19, Many sciences  while passing through this  second or classificatory stage  assume the title of comparative,2
46, When the  anatomist has finished the dissection of numerous bodies  when he has  given names to each organ  and discovered the distinctive functions of  each  he is led to perceive similarity where at first he saw dissimilarity  only,2
53, He discovers in the lower animals rudimentary indications of the  more perfect organization of the higher  and he becomes impressed with the  conviction that there is in the animal kingdom the same order and purpose  which pervades the endless variety of plants or any other realm of nature,2
80,  He learns  if he did not know it before  that things were not created at  random or in a lump  but that there is a scale which leads  by  imperceptible degrees  from the lowest infusoria to the crowning work of  nature  '97man  that all is the manifestation of one and the same unbroken  chain of creative thought  the work of one and the same all-wise Creator,2
26,    In this way the second or classificatory leads us naturally to the third  or final stage '97the theoretical  or metaphysical,2
56, If the work of  classification is properly carried out  it teaches us that nothing exists  in nature by accident  that each individual belongs to a species  each  species to a genus  and that there are laws which underlie the apparent  freedom and variety of all created things,2
74, These laws indicate to us the  presence of a purpose in the mind of the Creator  and whereas the material  world was looked upon by ancient philosophers as a mere illusion  as an  agglomerate of atoms  or as the work of an evil principle  we now read and  interpret its pages as the revelation of a divine power  and wisdom  and  love,2
12, This has given to the study of nature a new character,2
37, After the  observer has collected his facts  and after the classifier has placed them  in order  the student asks what is the origin and what is the meaning of  all this,2
27, and he tries to soar  by means of induction  or sometimes even  of divination  into regions not accessible to the mere collector,2
38, In this  attempt the mind of man no doubt has frequently met with the fate of  Phaeton  but  undismayed by failure  he asks again and again for his  father '92s steeds,2
43, It has been said that this so-called philosophy of nature  has never achieved anything  that it has done nothing but prove that  things must be exactly as they had been found to be by the observer and  collector,2
30, Physical science  however  would never have been what it is  without the impulses which it received from the philosopher  nay even from  the poet,2
33,  '93At the limits of exact knowledge '94 (I quote the words of  Humboldt)   '93as from a lofty island-shore  the eye loves to glance towards  distant regions,2
49, The images which it sees may be illusive  but  like the  illusive images which people imagined they had seen from the Canaries or  the Azores  long before the time of Columbus  they may lead to the  discovery of a new world,2
17, '94    Copernicus  in the dedication of his work to Pope Paul III,2
63, (it was  commenced in 1517  finished 1530  published 1543)  confesses that he was  brought to the discovery of the sun '92s central position  and of the diurnal  motion of the earth  not by observation or analysis  but by what he calls  the feeling of a want of symmetry in the Ptolemaic system,2
32, But who had  told him that there _must_ be symmetry in all the movements of the  celestial bodies  or that complication was not more sublime than  simplicity,2
19, Symmetry and simplicity  before they were discovered by the  observer  were postulated by the philosopher,2
32, The first idea of  revolutionizing the heavens was suggested to Copernicus  as he tells us  himself  by an ancient Greek philosopher  by Philolaus  the Pythagorean,2
26,  No doubt with Philolaus the motion of the earth was only a guess  or  if  you like  a happy intuition,2
31, Nevertheless  if we may trust the words of  Copernicus  it is quite possible that without that guess we should never  have heard of the Copernican system,2
11, Truth is not found by addition and  multiplication only,2
65, When speaking of Kepler  whose method of reasoning  has been considered as unsafe and fantastic by his contemporaries as well  as by later astronomers  Sir David Brewster remarks very truly   '93that  as  an instrument of research  the influence of imagination has been much  overlooked by those who have ventured to give laws to philosophy,2
23, '94 The  torch of imagination is as necessary to him who looks for truth  as the  lamp of study,2
27, Kepler held both  and more than that  he had the star of  faith to guide him in all things from darkness to light,2
38,    In the history of the physical sciences  the three stages which we have  just described as the empirical  the classificatory  and the theoretical   appear generally in chronological order,2
38, I say  generally  for there have  been instances  as in the case just quoted of Philolaus  where the results  properly belonging to the third have been anticipated in the first stage,2
33,  To the quick eye of genius one case may be like a thousand  and one  experiment  well chosen  may lead to the discovery of an absolute law,2
13,  Besides  there are great chasms in the history of science,2
49, The tradition  of generations is broken by political or ethnic earthquakes  and the work  that was nearly finished has frequently had to be done again from the  beginning  when a new surface had been formed for the growth of a new  civilization,2
31, The succession  however  of these three stages is no doubt  the natural one  and it is very properly observed in the study of every  science,2
11, The student of botany begins as a collector of plants,2
27, Taking  each plant by itself  he observes its peculiar character  its habitat  its  proper season  its popular or unscientific name,2
28, He learns to distinguish  between the roots  the stem  the leaves  the flower  the calyx  the  stamina  and pistils,2
27, He learns  so to say  the practical grammar of the  plant before he can begin to compare  to arrange  and classify,2
27,    Again  no one can enter with advantage on the third stage of any physical  science without having passed through the second,2
60, No one can study _the_  plant  no one can understand the bearing of such a work as  for instance   Professor Schleiden '92s  '93Life of the Plant  '94(11) who has not studied the  life of plants in the wonderful variety  and in the still more wonderful  order  of nature,2
23, These last and highest achievements of inductive  philosophy are possible only after the way has been cleared by previous  classification,2
17, The philosopher must command his classes like regiments  which obey the order of their general,2
13, Thus alone can the battle be fought  and truth be conquered,2
57,    After this rapid glance at the history of the other physical sciences  we  now return to our own  the science of language  in order to see whether it  really is a science  and whether it can be brought back to the standard of  the inductive sciences,2
43, We want to know whether it has passed  or is still  passing  through the three phases of physical research  whether its  progress has been systematic or desultory  whether its method has been  appropriate or not,2
19, But before we do this  we shall  I think  have to do  something else,2
79, You may have observed that I always took it for granted  that the science of language  which is best known in this country by the  name of comparative philology  is one of the physical sciences  and that  therefore its method ought to be the same as that which has been followed  with so much success in botany  geology  anatomy  and other branches of  the study of nature,2
45, In the history of the physical sciences  however  we  look in vain for a place assigned to comparative philology  and its very  name would seem to show that it belongs to quite a different sphere of  human knowledge,2
23, There are two great divisions of human knowledge  which   according to their subject-matter  are called _physical_ and _historical_,2
19,  Physical science deals with the works of God  historical science with the  works of man,2
68, Now if we were to judge by its name  comparative philology   like classical philology  would seem to take rank  not as a physical  but  as an historical science  and the proper method to be applied to it would  be that which is followed in the history of art  of law  of politics  and  religion,2
16, However  the title of comparative philology must not be allowed  to mislead us,2
75, It is difficult to say by whom that title was invented  but  all that can be said in defence of it is  that the founders of the science  of language were chiefly scholars or philologists  and that they based  their inquiries into the nature and laws of language on a comparison of as  many facts as they could collect within their own special spheres of  study,2
36, Neither in Germany  which may well be called the birthplace of this  science  nor in France  where it has been cultivated with brilliant  success  has that title been adopted,2
57, It will not be difficult to show  that  although the science of language owes much to the classical scholar   and though in return it has proved of great use to him  yet comparative  philology has really nothing whatever in common with philology in the  usual meaning of the word,2
27, Philology  whether classical or oriental   whether treating of ancient or modern  of cultivated or barbarous  languages  is an historical science,2
10, Language is here treated simply as a  means,2
87, The classical scholar uses Greek or Latin  the oriental scholar  Hebrew or Sanskrit  or any other language  as a key to an understanding of  the literary monuments which by-gone ages have bequeathed to us  as a  spell to raise from the tomb of time the thoughts of great men in  different ages and different countries  and as a means ultimately to trace  the social  moral  intellectual  and religious progress of the human race,2
27,  In the same manner  if we study living languages  it is not for their own  sake that we acquire grammars and vocabularies,2
11, We do so on account of  their practical usefulness,2
24, We use them as letters of introduction to the  best society or to the best literature of the leading nations of Europe,2
10,  In comparative philology the case is totally different,2
26, In the science of  language  languages are not treated as a means  language itself becomes  the sole object of scientific inquiry,2
63, Dialects which have never produced  any literature at all  the jargons of savage tribes  the clicks of the  Hottentots  and the vocal modulations of the Indo-Chinese are as  important  nay  for the solution of some of our problems  more important   than the poetry of Homer  or the prose of Cicero,2
78, We do not want to know  languages  we want to know language  what language is  how it can form a  vehicle or an organ of thought  we want to know its origin  its nature   its laws  and it is only in order to arrive at that knowledge that we  collect  arrange  and classify all the facts of language that are within  our reach,2
34,    And here I must protest  at the very outset of these lectures  against the  supposition that the student of language must necessarily be a great  linguist,2
36, I shall have to speak to you in the course of these lectures of  hundreds of languages  some of which  perhaps  you may never have heard  mentioned even by name,2
20, Do not suppose that I know these languages as you  know Greek or Latin  French or German,2
26, In that sense I know indeed very  few languages  and I never aspired to the fame of a Mithridates or a  Mezzofanti,2
24, It is impossible for a student of language to acquire a  practical knowledge of all tongues with which he has to deal,2
56, He does not  wish to speak the Kachikal language  of which a professorship was lately  founded in the University of Guatemala (12) or to acquire the elegancies  of the idiom of the Tcheremissians  nor is it his ambition to explore the  literature of the Samoyedes  or the New-Zealanders,2
16, It is the grammar and  the dictionary which form the subject of his inquiries,2
44, These he consults  and subjects to a careful analysis  but he does not encumber his memory  with paradigms of nouns and verbs  or with long lists of words which have  never been used in any work of literature,2
46, It is true  no doubt  that no  language will unveil the whole of its wonderful structure except to the  scholar who has studied it thoroughly and critically in a number of  literary works representing the various periods of its growth,2
46,  Nevertheless  short lists of vocables  and imperfect sketches of a  grammar  are in many instances all that the student can expect to obtain   or can hope to master and to use for the purposes he has in view,2
46, He must  learn to make the best of this fragmentary information  like the  comparative anatomist  who frequently learns his lessons from the smallest  fragments of fossil bones  or the vague pictures of animals brought home  by unscientific travellers,2
40, If it were necessary for the comparative  philologist to acquire a critical or practical acquaintance with all the  languages which form the subject of his inquiries  the science of language  would simply be an impossibility,2
28, But we do not expect the botanist to be  an experienced gardener  or the geologist a miner  or the ichthyologist a  practical fisherman,2
33, Nor would it be reasonable to object in the science  of language to the same division of labor which is necessary for the  successful cultivation of subjects much less comprehensive,2
87, Though much of  what we might call the realm of language is lost to us forever  though  whole periods in the history of language are by necessity withdrawn from  our observation  yet the mass of human speech that lies before us  whether  in the petrified strata of ancient literature or in the countless variety  of living languages and dialects  offers a field as large  if not larger   than any other branch of physical research,2
25, It is impossible to fix the  exact number of known languages  but their number can hardly be less than  nine hundred,2
66, That this vast field should never have excited the curiosity  of the natural philosopher before the beginning of our century may seem  surprising  more surprising even than the indifference with which former  generations treated the lessons which even the stones seemed to teach of  the life still throbbing in the veins and on the very surface of the  earth,2
18, The saying that "familiarity breeds contempt" would seem applicable  to the subjects of both these sciences,2
39, The gravel of our walks hardly  seemed to deserve a scientific treatment  and the language which every  plough-boy can speak could not be raised without an effort to the dignity  of a scientific problem,2
142, Man had studied every part of nature  the mineral  treasures in the bowels of the earth  the flowers of each season  the  animals of every continent  the laws of storms  and the movements of the  heavenly bodies  he had analyzed every substance  dissected every  organism  he knew every bone and muscle  every nerve and fibre of his own  body to the ultimate elements which compose his flesh and blood  he had  meditated on the nature of his soul  on the laws of his mind  and tried to  penetrate into the last causes of all being '97and yet language  without the  aid of which not even the first step in this glorious career could have  been made  remained unnoticed,2
21, Like a veil that hung too close over the  eye of the human mind  it was hardly perceived,2
245, In an age when the study  of antiquity attracted the most energetic minds  when the ashes of Pompeii  were sifted for the playthings of Roman life  when parchments were made to  disclose  by chemical means  the erased thoughts of Grecian thinkers  when  the tombs of Egypt were ransacked for their sacred contents  and the  palaces of Babylon and Nineveh forced to surrender the clay diaries of  Nebuchadnezzar  when everything  in fact  that seemed to contain a vestige  of the early life of man was anxiously searched for and carefully  preserved in our libraries and museums  '97language  which in itself carries  us back far beyond the cuneiform literature of Assyria and Babylonia  and  the hieroglyphic documents of Egypt  which connects ourselves  through an  unbroken chain of speech  with the very ancestors of our race  and still  draws its life from the first utterances of the human mind  '97language  the  living and speaking witness of the whole history of our race  was never  cross-examined by the student of history  was never made to disclose its  secrets until questioned and  so to say  brought back to itself within the  last fifty years  by the genius of a Humboldt  Bopp  Grimm  Bunsen  and  others,2
172, If you consider that  whatever view we take of the origin and  dispersion of language  nothing new has ever been added to the substance  of language  that all its changes have been changes of form  that no new  root or radical has ever been invented by later generations  as little as  one single element has ever been added to the material world in which we  live  if you bear in mind that in one sense  and in a very just sense  we  may be said to handle the very words which issued from the mouth of the  son of God  when he gave names to  '93all cattle  and to the fowl of the air   and to every beast of the field  '94 you will see  I believe  that the  science of language has claims on your attention  such as few sciences can  rival or excel,2
82,    Having thus explained the manner in which I intend to treat the science of  language  I hope in my next lecture to examine the objections of those  philosophers who see in language nothing but a contrivance devised by  human skill for the more expeditious communication of our thoughts  and  who would wish to see it treated  not as a production of nature  but as a  work of human art,2
