10, THE SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE ONE OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES,2
37,      When I was asked some time ago to deliver a course of lectures on  Comparative Philology in this Institution  I at once expressed my  readiness to do so,2
64, I had lived long enough in England to know that the  peculiar difficulties arising from my imperfect knowledge of the language  would be more than balanced by the forbearance of an English audience  and  I had such perfect faith in my subject that I thought it might be trusted  even in the hands of a less skilful expositor,2
98, I felt convinced that the  researches into the history of languages and into the nature of human  speech which have been carried on for the last fifty years in England   France  and Germany  deserved a larger share of public sympathy than they  had hitherto received  and it seemed to me  as far as I could judge  that  the discoveries in this newly-opened mine of scientific inquiry were not  inferior  whether in novelty or importance  to the most brilliant  discoveries of our age,2
28,    It was not till I began to write my lectures that I became aware of the  difficulties of the task I had undertaken,2
107, The dimensions of the science  of language are so vast that it is impossible in a course of nine lectures  to give more than a very general survey of it  and as one of the greatest  charms of this science consists in the minuteness of the analysis by which  each language  each dialect  each word  each grammatical form is tested  I  felt that it was almost impossible to do full justice to my subject  or to  place the achievements of those who founded and fostered the science of  language in their true light,2
19, Another difficulty arises from the dryness  of many of the problems which I shall have to discuss,2
33, Declensions and  conjugations cannot be made amusing  nor can I avail myself of the  advantages possessed by most lecturers  who enliven their discussions by  experiments and diagrams,2
106, If  with all these difficulties and drawbacks  I  do not shrink from opening to-day this course of lectures on mere words   on nouns and verbs and particles  '97if I venture to address an audience  accustomed to listen  in this place  to the wonderful tales of the natural  historian  the chemist  and geologist  and wont to see the novel results  of inductive reasoning invested by native eloquence  with all the charms  of poetry and romance  '97it is because  though mistrusting myself  I cannot  mistrust my subject,2
53, The study of words may be tedious to the school-boy   as breaking of stones is to the wayside laborer  but to the thoughtful eye  of the geologist these stones are full of interest  '97he sees miracles on  the high-road  and reads chronicles in every ditch,2
24, Language  too  has  marvels of her own  which she unveils to the inquiring glance of the  patient student,2
15, There are chronicles below her surface  there are sermons  in every word,2
16, Language has been called sacred ground  because it is the  deposit of thought,2
9, We cannot tell as yet what language is,2
20, It may be a  production of nature  a work of human art  or a divine gift,2
24, But to  whatever sphere it belongs  it would seem to stand unsurpassed '97nay   unequalled in it '97by anything else,2
23, If it be a production of nature  it is  her last and crowning production which she reserved for man alone,2
28, If it  be a work of human art  it would seem to lift the human artist almost to  the level of a divine creator,2
37, If it be the gift of God  it is God '92s  greatest gift  for through it God spake to man and man speaks to God in  worship  prayer  and meditation,2
72,    Although the way which is before us may be long and tedious  the point to  which it tends would seem to be full of interest  and I believe I may  promise that the view opened before our eyes from the summit of our  science  will fully repay the patient travellers  and perhaps secure a  free pardon to their venturous guide,2
112,                       uc0 u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208  u8208     The Science of Language is a science of very modern date,2
35, We cannot trace  its lineage much beyond the beginning of our century  and it is scarcely  received as yet on a footing of equality by the elder branches of  learning,2
56, Its very name is still unsettled  and the various titles that  have been given to it in England  France  and Germany are so vague and  varying that they have led to the most confused ideas among the public at  large as to the real objects of this new science,2
18, We hear it spoken of as  Comparative Philology  Scientific Etymology  Phonology  and Glossology,2
18, In  France it has received the convenient  but somewhat barbarous  name of  _Linguistique_,2
28, If we must have a Greek title for our science  we might  derive it either from _mythos_  word  or from _logos_  speech,2
21, But the  title of _Mythology_ is already occupied  and _Logology_ would jar too  much on classical ears,2
70, We need not waste our time in criticising these  names  as none of them has as yet received that universal sanction which  belongs to the titles of other modern sciences  such as Geology or  Comparative Anatomy  nor will there be much difficulty in christening our  young science after we have once ascertained its birth  its parentage  and  its character,2
32, I myself prefer the simple designation of the Science of  Language  though in these days of high-sounding titles  this plain name  will hardly meet with general acceptance,2
16,    From the name we now turn to the meaning of our science,2
75, But before we  enter upon a definition of its subject-matter  and determine the method  which ought to be followed in our researches  it will be useful to cast a  glance at the history of the other sciences  among which the science of  language now  for the first time  claims her place  and examine their  origin  their gradual progress  and definite settlement,2
69, The history of a  science is  as it were  its biography  and as we buy experience cheapest  in studying the lives of others  we may  perhaps  guard our young science  from some of the follies and extravagances inherent in youth by learning a  lesson for which other branches of human knowledge have had to pay more  dearly,2
15,    There is a certain uniformity in the history of most sciences,2
48, If we read  such works as Whewell '92s History of the Inductive Sciences or Humboldt '92s  Cosmos  we find that the origin  the progress  the causes of failure and  success have been the same for almost every branch of human knowledge,2
33,  There are three marked periods or stages in the history of every one of  them  which we may call the _Empirical_  the _Classificatory_  and the  _Theoretical_,2
35, However humiliating it may sound  every one of our  sciences  however grand their present titles  can be traced back to the  most humble and homely occupations of half-savage tribes,2
26, It was not the  true  the good  and the beautiful which spurred the early philosophers to  deep researches and bold discoveries,2
29, The foundation-stone of the most  glorious structures of human ingenuity in ages to come was supplied by the  pressing wants of a patriarchal and semi-barbarous society,2
19, The names of  some of the most ancient departments of human knowledge tell their own  tale,2
68, Geometry  which at present declares itself free from all sensuous  impressions  and treats of its points and lines and planes as purely ideal  conceptions  not to be confounded with those coarse and imperfect  representations as they appear on paper to the human eye  geometry  as its  very name declares  began with measuring a garden or a field,2
23, It is  derived from the Greek _g uc0 u275 _  land  ground  earth  and _metron_  measure,2
40,  Botany  the science of plants  was originally the science of _botan uc0 u275 _   which in Greek does not mean a plant in general  but fodder  from  _boskein_  to feed,2
19, The science of plants would have been called  Phytology  from the Greek _phyton_  a plant,2
20,(1) The founders of Astronomy  were not the poet or the philosopher  but the sailor and the farmer,2
53, The  early poet may have admired  '93the mazy dance of planets  '94 and the  philosopher may have speculated on the heavenly harmonies  but it was to  the sailor alone that a knowledge of the glittering guides of heaven  became a question of life and death,2
54, It was he who calculated their  risings and settings with the accuracy of a merchant and the shrewdness of  an adventurer  and the names that were given to single stars or  constellations clearly show that they were invented by the ploughers of  the sea and of the land,2
58, The moon  for instance  the golden hand on the  dark dial of heaven  was called by them the Measurer  '97the measurer of  time  for time was measured by nights  and moons  and winters  long before  it was reckoned by days  and suns  and years,2
7, Moon(2) is a very old word,2
64,  It was _m 'f4na_ in Anglo-Saxon  and was used there  not as a feminine  but  as a masculine  for the moon was a masculine in all Teutonic languages   and it is only through the influence of classical models that in English  moon has been changed into a feminine  and sun into a masculine,2
10, It was a  most unlucky assertion which Mr,2
26, Harris made in his _Hermes_  that all  nations ascribe to the sun a masculine  and to the moon a feminine  gender,2
11,(3) In Gothic moon is _mena_  which is a masculine,2
8, For month we  have in A,2
1,-S,2
11, _m 'f3n 'e2dh_  in Gothic _menoth_  both masculine,2
29, In Greek we  find _m uc0 u275 n_  a masculine  for month  and _m u275 n u275 _  a feminine  for moon,2
31, In  Latin we have the derivative _mensis_  month  and in Sanskrit we find  _m 'e2s_ for moon  and _m 'e2sa_ for month  both masculine,2
22,(4) Now this _m 'e2s_ in  Sanskrit is clearly derived from a root _m 'e2_  to measure  to mete,2
26, In  Sanskrit  I measure is _m 'e2-mi_  thou measurest  _m 'e2-si_  he measures   _m 'e2-ti_ (or _mim 'ee-te_),2
19, An instrument of measuring is called in Sanskrit  _m 'e2-tram_  the Greek _metron_  our metre,2
80, Now if the moon was originally  called by the farmer the measurer  the ruler of days  and weeks  and  seasons  the regulator of the tides  the lord of their festivals  and the  herald of their public assemblies  it is but natural that he should have  been conceived as a man  and not as the love-sick maiden which our modern  sentimental poetry has put in his place,2
48,    It was the sailor who  before intrusting his life and goods to the winds  and the waves of the ocean  watched for the rising of those stars which he  called the Sailing-stars or _Pleiades_  from _plein_  to sail,2
24, Navigation  in the Greek waters was considered safe after the return of the Pleiades   and it closed when they disappeared,2
19, The Latin name for the _Pleiades_ is  _Vergili 'e6_  from _virga_  a sprout or twig,2
31, This name was given to them by  the Italian husbandman  because in Italy  where they became visible about  May  they marked the return of summer,2
43,(5) Another constellation  the seven  stars in the head of Taurus  received the name of _Hyades_ or _Pluvi 'e6_ in  Latin  because at the time when they rose with the sun they were supposed  to announce rain,2
106, The astronomer retains these and many other names  he  still speaks of the pole of heaven  of wandering and fixed stars (6) but  he is apt to forget that these terms were not the result of scientific  observation and classification  but were borrowed from the language of  those who themselves were wanderers on the sea or in the desert  and to  whom the fixed stars were in full reality what their name implies  stars  driven in and fixed  by which they might hold fast on the deep  as by  heavenly anchors,2
84,    But although historically we are justified in saying that the first  geometrician was a ploughman  the first botanist a gardener  the first  mineralogist a miner  it may reasonably be objected that in this early  stage a science is hardly a science yet: that measuring a field is not  geometry  that growing cabbages is very far from botany  and that a  butcher has no claim to the title of comparative anatomist,2
39, This is  perfectly true  yet it is but right that each science should be reminded  of these its more humble beginnings  and of the practical requirements  which it was originally intended to answer,2
28, A science  as Bacon says   should be a rich storehouse for the glory of God  and the relief of man '92s  estate,2
91, Now  although it may seem as if in the present high state of our  society students were enabled to devote their time to the investigation of  the facts and laws of nature  or to the contemplation of the mysteries of  the world of thought  without any side-glance at the practical result of  their labors  no science and no art have long prospered and flourished  among us  unless they were in some way subservient to the practical  interests of society,2
43, It is true that a Lyell collects and arranges  a  Faraday weighs and analyzes  an Owen dissects and compares  a Herschel  observes and calculates  without any thought of the immediate marketable  results of their labors,2
33, But there is a general interest which supports  and enlivens their researches  and that interest depends on the practical  advantages which society at large derives from their scientific studies,2
68,  Let it be known that the successive strata of the geologist are a  deception to the miner  that the astronomical tables are useless to the  navigator  that chemistry is nothing but an expensive amusement  of no use  to the manufacturer and the farmer '97and astronomy  chemistry  and geology  would soon share the fate of alchemy and astrology,2
85, As long as the  Egyptian science excited the hopes of the invalid by mysterious  prescriptions (I may observe by the way that the hieroglyphic signs of our  modern prescriptions have been traced back by Champollion to the real  hieroglyphics of Egypt(7)) '97and as long as it instigated the avarice of its  patrons by the promise of the discovery of gold  it enjoyed a liberal  support at the courts of princes  and under the roofs of monasteries,2
22,  Though alchemy did not lead to the discovery of gold  it prepared the way  to discoveries more valuable,2
5, The same with astrology,2
16, Astrology was not  such mere imposition as it is generally supposed to have been,2
51, It is  counted as a science by so sound and sober a scholar as Melancthon  and  even Bacon allows it a place among the sciences  though admitting that  '93it  had better intelligence and confederacy with the imagination of man than  with his reason,2
55, '94 In spite of the strong condemnation which Luther  pronounced against astrology  astrology continued to sway the destinies of  Europe  and a hundred years after Luther  the astrologer was the  counsellor of princes and generals  while the founder of modern astronomy  died in poverty and despair,2
14, In our time the very rudiments of astrology  are lost and forgotten,2
32,(8) Even real and useful arts  as soon as they  cease to be useful  die away  and their secrets are sometimes lost beyond  the hope of recovery,2
59, When after the Reformation our churches and chapels  were divested of their artistic ornaments  in order to restore  in outward  appearance also  the simplicity and purity of the Christian church  the  colors of the painted windows began to fade away  and have never regained  their former depth and harmony,2
56, The invention of printing gave the  death-blow to the art of ornamental writing and of miniature-painting  employed in the illumination of manuscripts  and the best artists of the  present day despair of rivalling the minuteness  softness  and brilliancy  combined by the humble manufacturer of the medi 'e6val missal,2
43,    I speak somewhat feelingly on the necessity that every science should  answer some practical purpose  because I am aware that the science of  language has but little to offer to the utilitarian spirit of our age,2
33, It  does not profess to help us in learning languages more expeditiously  nor  does it hold out any hope of ever realizing the dream of one universal  language,2
33, It simply professes to teach what language is  and this would  hardly seem sufficient to secure for a new science the sympathy and  support of the public at large,2
35, There are problems  however  which  though  apparently of an abstruse and merely speculative character  have exercised  a powerful influence for good or evil in the history of mankind,2
48, Men  before now have fought for an idea  and have laid down their lives for a  word  and many of these problems which have agitated the world from the  earliest to our own times  belong properly to the science of language,2
23,    Mythology  which was the bane of the ancient world  is in truth a disease  of language,2
30, A myth means a word  but a word which  from being a name or  an attribute  has been allowed to assume a more substantial existence,2
40,  Most of the Greek  the Roman  the Indian  and other heathen gods are  nothing but poetical names  which were gradually allowed to assume a  divine personality never contemplated by their original inventors,2
25, _Eos_  was a name of the dawn before she became a goddess  the wife of  _Tithonos_  or the dying day,2
50, _Fatum_  or fate  meant originally what had  been spoken  and before Fate became a power  even greater than Jupiter  it  meant that which had once been spoken by Jupiter  and could never be  changed  '97not even by Jupiter himself,2
71, _Zeus_ originally meant the bright  heaven  in Sanskrit _Dyaus_  and many of the stories told of him as the  supreme god  had a meaning only as told originally of the bright heaven   whose rays  like golden rain  descend on the lap of the earth  the _Danae_  of old  kept by her father in the dark prison of winter,2
29, No one doubts  that _Luna_ was simply a name of the moon  but so was likewise _Lucina_   both derived from _lucere_  to shine,2
51, _Hecate_  too  was an old name of  the moon  the feminine of _Hekatos_ and _Hekatebolos_  the far-darting  sun  and _Pyrrha_  the Eve of the Greeks  was nothing but a name of the  red earth  and in particular of Thessaly,2
18, This mythological disease   though less virulent in modern languages  is by no means extinct,2
80,    During the Middle Ages the controversy between Nominalism and Realism   which agitated the church for centuries  and finally prepared the way for  the Reformation  was again  as its very name shows  a controversy on  names  on the nature of language  and on the relation of words to our  conceptions on one side  and to the realities of the outer world on the  other,2
31, Men were called heretics for believing that words such as _justice_  or _truth_ expressed only conceptions of our mind  not real things walking  about in broad daylight,2
27,    In modern times the science of language has been called in to settle some  of the most perplexing political and social questions,2
68,  '93Nations and  languages against dynasties and treaties  '94 this is what has remodelled   and will remodel still more  the map of Europe  and in America comparative  philologists have been encouraged to prove the impossibility of a common  origin of languages and races  in order to justify  by scientific  arguments  the unhallowed theory of slavery,2
51, Never do I remember to have  seen science more degraded than on the title-page of an American  publication in which  among the profiles of the different races of man   the profile of the ape was made to look more human than that of the negro,2
42,    Lastly  the problem of the position of man on the threshold between the  worlds of matter and spirit has of late assumed a very marked prominence  among the problems of the physical and mental sciences,2
139, It has absorbed  the thoughts of men who  after a long life spent in collecting  observing   and analyzing  have brought to its solution qualifications unrivalled in  any previous age  and if we may judge from the greater warmth displayed in  discussions ordinarily conducted with the calmness of judges and not with  the passion of pleaders  it might seem  after all  as if the great  problems of our being  of the true nobility of our blood  of our descent  from heaven or earth  though unconnected with anything that is commonly  called practical  have still retained a charm of their own '97a charm that  will never lose its power on the mind  and on the heart of man,2
60, Now   however much the frontiers of the animal kingdom have been pushed forward   so that at one time the line of demarcation between animal and man seemed  to depend on a mere fold in the brain  there is _one_ barrier which no one  has yet ventured to touch '97the barrier of language,2
56, Even those philosophers  with whom _penser c '92est sentir_ (9) who reduce all thought to feeling  and  maintain that we share the faculties which are the productive causes of  thought in common with beasts  are bound to confess that _as yet_ no race  of animals has produced a language,2
58, Lord Monboddo  for instance  admits  that as yet no animal has been discovered in the possession of language    '93not even the beaver  who of all the animals we know  that are not  like  the orang-outangs  of our own species  comes nearest to us in sagacity,2
58, '94    Locke  who is generally classed together with these materialistic  philosophers  and who certainly vindicated a large share of what had been  claimed for the intellect as the property of the senses  recognized most  fully the barrier which language  as such  placed between man and brutes,2
47,   '93This I may be positive in  '94 he writes   '93that the power of abstracting is  not at all in brutes  and that the having of general ideas is that which  puts a perfect distinction between man and brutes,2
57, For it is evident we  observe no footsteps in these of making use of general signs for universal  ideas  from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty  of abstracting or making general ideas  since they have no use of _words_  or any other general signs,2
106, '94    If  therefore  the science of language gives us an insight into that  which  by common consent  distinguishes man from all other living beings   if it establishes a frontier between man and the brute  which can never be  removed  it would seem to possess at the present moment peculiar claims on  the attention of all who  while watching with sincere admiration the  progress of comparative physiology  yet consider it their duty to enter  their manly protest against a revival of the shallow theories of Lord  Monboddo,2
17,    But to return to our survey of the history of the physical sciences,2
15, We  had examined the empirical stage through which every science has to pass,2
76,  We saw that  for instance  in botany  a man who has travelled through  distant countries  who has collected a vast number of plants  who knows  their names  their peculiarities  and their medicinal qualities  is not  yet a botanist  but only a herbalist  a lover of plants  or what the  Italians call a _dilettante_  from _dilettare_  to delight,2
20, The real  science of plants  like every other science  begins with the work of  classification,2
33, An empirical acquaintance with facts rises to a scientific  knowledge of facts as soon as the mind discovers beneath the multiplicity  of single productions the unity of an organic system,2
12, This discovery is  made by means of comparison and classification,2
48, We cease to study each  flower for its own sake  and by continually enlarging the sphere of our  observation  we try to discover what is common to many and offers those  essential points on which groups or natural classes may be established,2
50,  These classes again  in their more general features  are mutually  compared  new points of difference  or of similarity of a more general and  higher character  spring to view  and enable us to discover classes of  classes  or families,2
71, And when the whole kingdom of plants has thus been  surveyed  and a simple tissue of names been thrown over the garden of  nature  when we can lift it up  as it were  and view it in our mind as a  whole  as a system well defined and complete  we then speak of the science  of plants  or botany,2
60, We have entered into altogether a new sphere of  knowledge where the individual is subject to the general  fact to law  we  discover thought  order  and purpose pervading the whole realm of nature   and we perceive the dark chaos of matter lighted up by the reflection of a  divine mind,2
8, Such views may be right or wrong,2
29, Too hasty comparisons  or  too narrow distinctions  may have prevented the eye of the observer from  discovering the broad outlines of nature '92s plan,2
18, Yet every system  however  insufficient it may prove hereafter  is a step in advance,2
71, If the mind of  man is once impressed with the conviction that there must be order and law  everywhere  it never rests again until all that seems irregular has been  eliminated  until the full beauty and harmony of nature has been  perceived  and the eye of man has caught the eye of God beaming out from  the midst of all His works,2
13, The failures of the past prepare the triumphs  of the future,2
57,    Thus  to recur to our former illustration  the systematic arrangement of  plants which bears the name of Linn 'e6us  and which is founded on the number  and character of the reproductive organs  failed to bring out the natural  order which pervades all that grows and blossoms,2
24, Broad lines of  demarcation which unite or divide large tribes and families of plants were  invisible from his point of view,2
14, But in spite of this  his work was not  in vain,2
62, The fact that plants in every part of the world belonged to one  great system was established once for all  and even in later systems most  of his classes and divisions have been preserved  because the conformation  of the reproductive organs of plants happened to run parallel with other  more characteristic marks of true affinity,2
11,(10) It is the same in the  history of astronomy,2
33, Although the Ptolem 'e6an system was a wrong one  yet  even from its eccentric point of view  laws were discovered determining  the true movements of the heavenly bodies,2
20, The conviction that there  remains something unexplained is sure to lead to the discovery of our  error,2
15, There can be no error in nature  the error must be with us,2
61, This  conviction lived in the heart of Aristotle when  in spite of his imperfect  knowledge of nature  he declared  '93that there is in nature nothing  interpolated or without connection  as in a bad tragedy  '94 and from his  time forward every new fact and every new system have confirmed his faith,2
10,    The object of classification is clear,2
60, We understand things if we can  comprehend them  that is to say  if we can grasp and hold together single  facts  connect isolated impressions  distinguish between what is essential  and what is merely accidental  and thus predicate the general of the  individual  and class the individual under the general,2
10, This is the secret  of all scientific knowledge,2
19, Many sciences  while passing through this  second or classificatory stage  assume the title of comparative,2
46, When the  anatomist has finished the dissection of numerous bodies  when he has  given names to each organ  and discovered the distinctive functions of  each  he is led to perceive similarity where at first he saw dissimilarity  only,2
53, He discovers in the lower animals rudimentary indications of the  more perfect organization of the higher  and he becomes impressed with the  conviction that there is in the animal kingdom the same order and purpose  which pervades the endless variety of plants or any other realm of nature,2
80,  He learns  if he did not know it before  that things were not created at  random or in a lump  but that there is a scale which leads  by  imperceptible degrees  from the lowest infusoria to the crowning work of  nature  '97man  that all is the manifestation of one and the same unbroken  chain of creative thought  the work of one and the same all-wise Creator,2
26,    In this way the second or classificatory leads us naturally to the third  or final stage '97the theoretical  or metaphysical,2
56, If the work of  classification is properly carried out  it teaches us that nothing exists  in nature by accident  that each individual belongs to a species  each  species to a genus  and that there are laws which underlie the apparent  freedom and variety of all created things,2
74, These laws indicate to us the  presence of a purpose in the mind of the Creator  and whereas the material  world was looked upon by ancient philosophers as a mere illusion  as an  agglomerate of atoms  or as the work of an evil principle  we now read and  interpret its pages as the revelation of a divine power  and wisdom  and  love,2
12, This has given to the study of nature a new character,2
37, After the  observer has collected his facts  and after the classifier has placed them  in order  the student asks what is the origin and what is the meaning of  all this,2
27, and he tries to soar  by means of induction  or sometimes even  of divination  into regions not accessible to the mere collector,2
38, In this  attempt the mind of man no doubt has frequently met with the fate of  Phaeton  but  undismayed by failure  he asks again and again for his  father '92s steeds,2
43, It has been said that this so-called philosophy of nature  has never achieved anything  that it has done nothing but prove that  things must be exactly as they had been found to be by the observer and  collector,2
30, Physical science  however  would never have been what it is  without the impulses which it received from the philosopher  nay even from  the poet,2
33,  '93At the limits of exact knowledge '94 (I quote the words of  Humboldt)   '93as from a lofty island-shore  the eye loves to glance towards  distant regions,2
49, The images which it sees may be illusive  but  like the  illusive images which people imagined they had seen from the Canaries or  the Azores  long before the time of Columbus  they may lead to the  discovery of a new world,2
17, '94    Copernicus  in the dedication of his work to Pope Paul III,2
63, (it was  commenced in 1517  finished 1530  published 1543)  confesses that he was  brought to the discovery of the sun '92s central position  and of the diurnal  motion of the earth  not by observation or analysis  but by what he calls  the feeling of a want of symmetry in the Ptolemaic system,2
32, But who had  told him that there _must_ be symmetry in all the movements of the  celestial bodies  or that complication was not more sublime than  simplicity,2
19, Symmetry and simplicity  before they were discovered by the  observer  were postulated by the philosopher,2
32, The first idea of  revolutionizing the heavens was suggested to Copernicus  as he tells us  himself  by an ancient Greek philosopher  by Philolaus  the Pythagorean,2
26,  No doubt with Philolaus the motion of the earth was only a guess  or  if  you like  a happy intuition,2
31, Nevertheless  if we may trust the words of  Copernicus  it is quite possible that without that guess we should never  have heard of the Copernican system,2
11, Truth is not found by addition and  multiplication only,2
65, When speaking of Kepler  whose method of reasoning  has been considered as unsafe and fantastic by his contemporaries as well  as by later astronomers  Sir David Brewster remarks very truly   '93that  as  an instrument of research  the influence of imagination has been much  overlooked by those who have ventured to give laws to philosophy,2
23, '94 The  torch of imagination is as necessary to him who looks for truth  as the  lamp of study,2
27, Kepler held both  and more than that  he had the star of  faith to guide him in all things from darkness to light,2
38,    In the history of the physical sciences  the three stages which we have  just described as the empirical  the classificatory  and the theoretical   appear generally in chronological order,2
38, I say  generally  for there have  been instances  as in the case just quoted of Philolaus  where the results  properly belonging to the third have been anticipated in the first stage,2
33,  To the quick eye of genius one case may be like a thousand  and one  experiment  well chosen  may lead to the discovery of an absolute law,2
13,  Besides  there are great chasms in the history of science,2
49, The tradition  of generations is broken by political or ethnic earthquakes  and the work  that was nearly finished has frequently had to be done again from the  beginning  when a new surface had been formed for the growth of a new  civilization,2
31, The succession  however  of these three stages is no doubt  the natural one  and it is very properly observed in the study of every  science,2
11, The student of botany begins as a collector of plants,2
27, Taking  each plant by itself  he observes its peculiar character  its habitat  its  proper season  its popular or unscientific name,2
28, He learns to distinguish  between the roots  the stem  the leaves  the flower  the calyx  the  stamina  and pistils,2
27, He learns  so to say  the practical grammar of the  plant before he can begin to compare  to arrange  and classify,2
27,    Again  no one can enter with advantage on the third stage of any physical  science without having passed through the second,2
60, No one can study _the_  plant  no one can understand the bearing of such a work as  for instance   Professor Schleiden '92s  '93Life of the Plant  '94(11) who has not studied the  life of plants in the wonderful variety  and in the still more wonderful  order  of nature,2
23, These last and highest achievements of inductive  philosophy are possible only after the way has been cleared by previous  classification,2
17, The philosopher must command his classes like regiments  which obey the order of their general,2
13, Thus alone can the battle be fought  and truth be conquered,2
57,    After this rapid glance at the history of the other physical sciences  we  now return to our own  the science of language  in order to see whether it  really is a science  and whether it can be brought back to the standard of  the inductive sciences,2
43, We want to know whether it has passed  or is still  passing  through the three phases of physical research  whether its  progress has been systematic or desultory  whether its method has been  appropriate or not,2
19, But before we do this  we shall  I think  have to do  something else,2
79, You may have observed that I always took it for granted  that the science of language  which is best known in this country by the  name of comparative philology  is one of the physical sciences  and that  therefore its method ought to be the same as that which has been followed  with so much success in botany  geology  anatomy  and other branches of  the study of nature,2
45, In the history of the physical sciences  however  we  look in vain for a place assigned to comparative philology  and its very  name would seem to show that it belongs to quite a different sphere of  human knowledge,2
23, There are two great divisions of human knowledge  which   according to their subject-matter  are called _physical_ and _historical_,2
19,  Physical science deals with the works of God  historical science with the  works of man,2
68, Now if we were to judge by its name  comparative philology   like classical philology  would seem to take rank  not as a physical  but  as an historical science  and the proper method to be applied to it would  be that which is followed in the history of art  of law  of politics  and  religion,2
16, However  the title of comparative philology must not be allowed  to mislead us,2
75, It is difficult to say by whom that title was invented  but  all that can be said in defence of it is  that the founders of the science  of language were chiefly scholars or philologists  and that they based  their inquiries into the nature and laws of language on a comparison of as  many facts as they could collect within their own special spheres of  study,2
36, Neither in Germany  which may well be called the birthplace of this  science  nor in France  where it has been cultivated with brilliant  success  has that title been adopted,2
57, It will not be difficult to show  that  although the science of language owes much to the classical scholar   and though in return it has proved of great use to him  yet comparative  philology has really nothing whatever in common with philology in the  usual meaning of the word,2
27, Philology  whether classical or oriental   whether treating of ancient or modern  of cultivated or barbarous  languages  is an historical science,2
10, Language is here treated simply as a  means,2
87, The classical scholar uses Greek or Latin  the oriental scholar  Hebrew or Sanskrit  or any other language  as a key to an understanding of  the literary monuments which by-gone ages have bequeathed to us  as a  spell to raise from the tomb of time the thoughts of great men in  different ages and different countries  and as a means ultimately to trace  the social  moral  intellectual  and religious progress of the human race,2
27,  In the same manner  if we study living languages  it is not for their own  sake that we acquire grammars and vocabularies,2
11, We do so on account of  their practical usefulness,2
24, We use them as letters of introduction to the  best society or to the best literature of the leading nations of Europe,2
10,  In comparative philology the case is totally different,2
26, In the science of  language  languages are not treated as a means  language itself becomes  the sole object of scientific inquiry,2
63, Dialects which have never produced  any literature at all  the jargons of savage tribes  the clicks of the  Hottentots  and the vocal modulations of the Indo-Chinese are as  important  nay  for the solution of some of our problems  more important   than the poetry of Homer  or the prose of Cicero,2
78, We do not want to know  languages  we want to know language  what language is  how it can form a  vehicle or an organ of thought  we want to know its origin  its nature   its laws  and it is only in order to arrive at that knowledge that we  collect  arrange  and classify all the facts of language that are within  our reach,2
34,    And here I must protest  at the very outset of these lectures  against the  supposition that the student of language must necessarily be a great  linguist,2
36, I shall have to speak to you in the course of these lectures of  hundreds of languages  some of which  perhaps  you may never have heard  mentioned even by name,2
20, Do not suppose that I know these languages as you  know Greek or Latin  French or German,2
26, In that sense I know indeed very  few languages  and I never aspired to the fame of a Mithridates or a  Mezzofanti,2
24, It is impossible for a student of language to acquire a  practical knowledge of all tongues with which he has to deal,2
56, He does not  wish to speak the Kachikal language  of which a professorship was lately  founded in the University of Guatemala (12) or to acquire the elegancies  of the idiom of the Tcheremissians  nor is it his ambition to explore the  literature of the Samoyedes  or the New-Zealanders,2
16, It is the grammar and  the dictionary which form the subject of his inquiries,2
44, These he consults  and subjects to a careful analysis  but he does not encumber his memory  with paradigms of nouns and verbs  or with long lists of words which have  never been used in any work of literature,2
46, It is true  no doubt  that no  language will unveil the whole of its wonderful structure except to the  scholar who has studied it thoroughly and critically in a number of  literary works representing the various periods of its growth,2
46,  Nevertheless  short lists of vocables  and imperfect sketches of a  grammar  are in many instances all that the student can expect to obtain   or can hope to master and to use for the purposes he has in view,2
46, He must  learn to make the best of this fragmentary information  like the  comparative anatomist  who frequently learns his lessons from the smallest  fragments of fossil bones  or the vague pictures of animals brought home  by unscientific travellers,2
40, If it were necessary for the comparative  philologist to acquire a critical or practical acquaintance with all the  languages which form the subject of his inquiries  the science of language  would simply be an impossibility,2
28, But we do not expect the botanist to be  an experienced gardener  or the geologist a miner  or the ichthyologist a  practical fisherman,2
33, Nor would it be reasonable to object in the science  of language to the same division of labor which is necessary for the  successful cultivation of subjects much less comprehensive,2
87, Though much of  what we might call the realm of language is lost to us forever  though  whole periods in the history of language are by necessity withdrawn from  our observation  yet the mass of human speech that lies before us  whether  in the petrified strata of ancient literature or in the countless variety  of living languages and dialects  offers a field as large  if not larger   than any other branch of physical research,2
25, It is impossible to fix the  exact number of known languages  but their number can hardly be less than  nine hundred,2
66, That this vast field should never have excited the curiosity  of the natural philosopher before the beginning of our century may seem  surprising  more surprising even than the indifference with which former  generations treated the lessons which even the stones seemed to teach of  the life still throbbing in the veins and on the very surface of the  earth,2
18, The saying that "familiarity breeds contempt" would seem applicable  to the subjects of both these sciences,2
39, The gravel of our walks hardly  seemed to deserve a scientific treatment  and the language which every  plough-boy can speak could not be raised without an effort to the dignity  of a scientific problem,2
142, Man had studied every part of nature  the mineral  treasures in the bowels of the earth  the flowers of each season  the  animals of every continent  the laws of storms  and the movements of the  heavenly bodies  he had analyzed every substance  dissected every  organism  he knew every bone and muscle  every nerve and fibre of his own  body to the ultimate elements which compose his flesh and blood  he had  meditated on the nature of his soul  on the laws of his mind  and tried to  penetrate into the last causes of all being '97and yet language  without the  aid of which not even the first step in this glorious career could have  been made  remained unnoticed,2
21, Like a veil that hung too close over the  eye of the human mind  it was hardly perceived,2
245, In an age when the study  of antiquity attracted the most energetic minds  when the ashes of Pompeii  were sifted for the playthings of Roman life  when parchments were made to  disclose  by chemical means  the erased thoughts of Grecian thinkers  when  the tombs of Egypt were ransacked for their sacred contents  and the  palaces of Babylon and Nineveh forced to surrender the clay diaries of  Nebuchadnezzar  when everything  in fact  that seemed to contain a vestige  of the early life of man was anxiously searched for and carefully  preserved in our libraries and museums  '97language  which in itself carries  us back far beyond the cuneiform literature of Assyria and Babylonia  and  the hieroglyphic documents of Egypt  which connects ourselves  through an  unbroken chain of speech  with the very ancestors of our race  and still  draws its life from the first utterances of the human mind  '97language  the  living and speaking witness of the whole history of our race  was never  cross-examined by the student of history  was never made to disclose its  secrets until questioned and  so to say  brought back to itself within the  last fifty years  by the genius of a Humboldt  Bopp  Grimm  Bunsen  and  others,2
172, If you consider that  whatever view we take of the origin and  dispersion of language  nothing new has ever been added to the substance  of language  that all its changes have been changes of form  that no new  root or radical has ever been invented by later generations  as little as  one single element has ever been added to the material world in which we  live  if you bear in mind that in one sense  and in a very just sense  we  may be said to handle the very words which issued from the mouth of the  son of God  when he gave names to  '93all cattle  and to the fowl of the air   and to every beast of the field  '94 you will see  I believe  that the  science of language has claims on your attention  such as few sciences can  rival or excel,2
82,    Having thus explained the manner in which I intend to treat the science of  language  I hope in my next lecture to examine the objections of those  philosophers who see in language nothing but a contrivance devised by  human skill for the more expeditious communication of our thoughts  and  who would wish to see it treated  not as a production of nature  but as a  work of human art,2
